Toler COA: Timothy N. Toler, Esq.Hurst Sawyer & Toler LLC1000 Parkwood Circle SESuite 220 Atlanta, GA 30339678-400-2599 ttoler@hst.law 

Motion to dismiss filed 2020-10-08, discovery stayed per 9-11-12 for 90 days until 2021-01-06, so discovery runs 2021-07-06. We have fairly unhelpful discovery responses from GSS and URS; next step is to depose Justin Pritchard (with a more specific document request) from SS, but we need to review SS responses first. Not letting anyone out until the Court rules on the mtn to dismiss.

URS served 2020-08-26, Sandy Springs and GSS service 2020-09-08, DOL 2020-08-30 so dl to add MARTA or other 3d parties 2020-12-30. URS answered without concerning defenses 2020-09-24, Sandy Springs answered with MTD 2020-10-08. Damages in excess of 40k after surgery. MTD response and mtn to add parties filed 2020-11-05, parties motion withdrawn. Medical 43,429.75. GSS Motion to Open Default is granted.

Godinho v. City of Tybee Island, 1998, 231 Ga.App. 377, 499 S.E.2d 389, certiorari granted, reversed 270 Ga. 567, 511 S.E.2d 517, reconsideration denied, on remand 1999 WL 144577; Hagan v. Georgia Dept. of Transp., 2013, 321 Ga.App. 472, 739 S.E.2d 123, reconsideration denied.

Slip and fall at a Captain Ds with fracture, medical is 7,326.29. Answers filed 3/18, no concerning defenses. VJM admits control of the premises and a duty to inspect (but not to remediate all potential hazards), will not admit or deny invitee status. Egress was allegedly through an emergency door. 

Venue defense as to VJM. Ds denies ownership etc., duty, knowledge, coverage through VJM, states that VJM is "wholly independent" and "individually licensed"; franchise agreement produced.

Gwinnett venue via CD. Franchise agreement requires VJM not to make any changes to blueprint specifications, provides for "consultation and advice" re training etc, management training program, training material - I think we can keep them in. Expansion plans marked "Sagitarrius Brands," which was CD. McClure was contractor on expansion, Stan Fuller did the framing, Wimpy did the slab.

DO NOT ID Satterfield yet.

No treatment since last year. Continuing pain and reduction in use. OOS sent for 50k. JS sending a mediation letter.

ministerial duty?

DOL 12/10/19, Disposition 7/17/20

Hunt alleges Pl failed to yield. Refers to on-board camera? Refuses to give up Facebook.

School district refused to give litigation history to UM. FU re cameras and tracking devices. Basically their liability argument is that our client (who was at a stop signal) should have backed up to yield? Weird argument, they definitely hit someone outside of their lane. I think this is on hold pending mediation? Policies at https://simbli.eboardsolutions.com/Policy/PolicyListing.aspx?S=4072

Privilege log re claim file and incident report. No video from the hallway. Plenty of insurance. NOT A PREMISES CASE, it's just a negligence case. Need to amend to add lost income?

State Farm served as UM 2020-07-01, did not answer (P counsel State Farm also). Specials low, but tbi; Per SKL don't make an offer of settlement // NB STANDING ORDER re various  // client taking from her 401k. lost wages are a mess because of the prior incident.

Substitute service on Cotton, service defense withdrawn. No extension per SKL, discovery ran 6/10. Admit simple negligence, testifies he doesn't know if my client could have avoided, he didn't see her. We have a good witness, don't depose officer per SKL.

2022-02-23 new job ending, processing issues, may be ending. Started Jan 21. Creating fiduciary training deck. Issues with communications and chain of command, regulatory knowledge. Steve will be sure she gets 40k with policy limits.

Table case, refiled 2021-02-26 against all three defendants. NB no info re the sub who did the remodel. Hefco answered 3/22 with no concerning defenses, although we should probably consider withdrawing 13-6-11 as to them. GRCC answered 4/14 with SOL and jxn defenses, probably rote. Ingles answered 4/26 no concerning defenses. Demands increased to 4MM each.

Ingles witnesses and 2x 30b6 deposed. Several 30b6 and engineering witnesses deposed GRCC. 2x 30b6 Hefco. Leonard Backer done. Mediating before we do any more experts. Had trouble finding a 2d engineering expert, but the GRCC depos helped a lot. They think the gutted us with the Baker depo, I'm not so sure, but it was pretty ugly. We ID'd Hinrich and Henninger. Discovery closed 6/23.

DOL Feb 10, 2019. Nursing malpractice case - another bed alarm -- NOT a death case. Amendment adding PWS filed 6/9, 122d ran 6/11. Answers filed, no concerning defenses (except boilerplate re the affidavit). Medical liens dropped a LOT. There were other witnesses, but the nurse is enough imo, no more depos per skl. Very simple case, she left the alarm off intentionally so Ms. Dunham could sleep. Borrowed servant doctrine. Discovery ran 1/6.

[Expert - Nurse not correct. Worried about Bradon scale, but that's actually sores. Morse scores should be zero or 25+ with a fall history. Other issues should have increased it more. She's wrong no need for fall precautions. Several things we could look at. Joint commission says bed alarms will not stop fall necessarily but might.]

Amend to remove allegation re non-functioning alarm.

Walmart entities answered 2020-03-19 via  with venue, jxn and SOL defenses - Dahlonege Group LLC answered 2020-04-08 same atty same defenses - KO entities answered 2020-04-09 with service, SOL, venue, and jxn defenses. Consent substitution 2020-10-16 switched out KO entities to CCBCU-E. Prelit demand 2019-11-20 for 750k. PJI demanded. First offer 40k 2020-01-15. No demand to KO (added late). Walmart has 1MM (Self National Union Fire), plus undisclosed excess. KO has 1MM (Chubb). Colleen thought the case was worth 200-250k at 100% liability, discounted from there. 

--> If not settled r file re status, witnesses, medical, FF, loss of capacity; fu with Nicole re affidavit, manual, depose "inspection witness" (maybe), doc, etc

We discussed doing depositions of Seabolt and Gorecki, that's on hold pending mediation. Per SC no need for experts, medical is what it is. Discovery ran 6/30.
