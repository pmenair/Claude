Generally, when a landlord evicts a tenant and takes possession of the premises, the lease is terminated and the right to claim rent which accrues after eviction is extinguished. Bentley-Kessinger v. Jones, 186 Ga. App. 466, 467 ( 367 S.E.2d 317) (1988). However, the "parties to a lease agreement may contract in advance to hold the lessee liable for rent even after an eviction, deducting therefrom only the amounts recovered by the lessor from reletting the premises \ldots{} [if such an agreement is] premised on the existence of an explicit and detailed provision in the lease which clearly and unequivocally expressed the parties' intention to hold the lessee responsible for after-accrued rent even should an eviction take place." (Citation and punctuation omitted.) Id. at 467-468; Hardin v. Macon Mall, 169 Ga. App. 793 ( 315 S.E.2d 4) (1984).

Discovery is over. This is the case where we have the gas station video.

Discovery ran March 4, 2021, not going to depose anyone else re entrustment, primary liability is pretty clear. Medical mostly on lien, preexisting. Service defense withdrawn per discovery responses, which are good. Admit simple negligence. Client has continuing pain, we have video of the accident. Evaluation less than 2x bc gaps in treatment, lots of injections.

Medical needs work, doctor or expert, maybe life care plan or FCE. No OOS. No surgery bc no insurance, not a surgical candidate, SKL to talk to UM.

Let Johanson out? ACM found an additional 25k in coverage, also from State Farm

D admits that she "inadvertantly caused" the collision, pled comparative fault, won't commit re no non-party fault. Hiding the ball on surveillance? Remember we spoke with the officer. 

Need MIL re referral from our office, DL. They are going to hammer her on the gap in treatment, operating without a license. SOL defense withdrawn. UM responses to discovery not great, but they tendered and we took their money. We are not going to identify Cabot, he's consulting only.

SC thinks meds are a little sketchy but "arguable" - MIL re DUI --> use son as adverse inference, r file re status - Discovery ran 9/19.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{<2023-05-05 Fri> } Follow up: [Deane] Getting PPD rating, medical narrative from Axion, get more FF (best friend or minister), talk to mom, SKL to talk to spine doc and set up depo dates later for August (Julyish)

Tom Wright is rebuttal only. I discussed with SKL the consortium issue and we decided to wait; Court would probably not grant leave under the good cause standard. See rss discussion in notes.

Per Rhyder untreated aneurysm, could have caused fall. Headache? Pattern of blood classic for aneurysm, distinct, in addition to the trauma, if she had to guess that's what happened here. Post settlement discovery conference was 12/9. Response to msj filed 12/13.

DOL 2019-10-23 They identify State Farm personnel in discovery? No responses re prior litigation, limited medical detail provided except that he was on an antibiotic. Client lives in FL. We produced financial info for Karen, her loss of income because she had to move with her husband is part of the claims, need to put numbers on all of this though. D pled nolo, is crazy and armed. Significant collision. D looks much more injured than client at scene. He claims sudden medical emergency, client told officer he had to stop suddenly.

Acute headache at hospital day of collision, MRI normal, back pain "feels like it's muscular," no Fx, no radiculopathy. Tinnitus maybe due to Rx (my guess)? Chronic neck and shoulder pain after, did PT, RFA, injxn. 2d MVA in 2021. They contend not related. Cabot on review suggests headaches have resolved, he can't speak to the tinnitus, thinks that the sprain exacerbated pre-existing facet arthritis, possible causation of shoulder tear but he is unclear. We sent an OOS for \$150,000. 

Bad neuro, do not produce. ADDED CONSORTIUM, discovery ran 6/2

Headaches and blurry vision post-MVA. Post-accident fall caused by sciatic pain. \$21,894.20 medical as of 7/19, needs update. Per CS value at 35-40k. HOWEVER, surgical recommendation; he got bariatric surgery to lose weight for the back procedure. We made policy limits demand to USAA, their top offer was \$32,225, litigation OOS 100,000. 

Progressive answer 4/9 with no concerning defenses. French is in default. Will need to update medical. Other driver filed in 2019. Rear end, client was middle car, stopped for vehicle turning left. Vehicle total loss. Per default order discovery is damages only.

Response to UM discovery sent -- service was notorious -- serve UM discovery? Fitts fishing re Yarb. I reviewed his discovery responses, which were pretentious and annoying and generally withholding, but suggest no 6.4. They will stip to coverage.

Rogs and RFD, they produced what looks like the whole claim file, lots of objection to e.g. medical rogs on the ground that they stipulated liability. Many references to the other case.

No OOS per SKL, work on the medicine. Floyd recorded statement produced. Per SC spine is related, not ocular, not good for tbi bc ETOH, psych, and lack of other evidence. Most recent neuro relates to spine per doctor.
