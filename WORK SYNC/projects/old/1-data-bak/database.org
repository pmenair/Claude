contruction zone Forsyth accident SOL 2024-01-30. Nelson and Baldwin answered 12/9 with no concerning defenses. Vertical Earth served 10/7, default opened.

Went for an MRI, Maloon talks about post-concussive. No presuit demands in file. Medpay 1,000 exhausted. NB we have plenty of body cam. No disposition on file. Seems like it's clearly a failure to yield though, and we have an expert.

Baldwin admits scope of employment, ownership of vehicle, denies direct negligence. Their driver denies liability, admits failure to yield but claims Hopkins was speeding and changed lanes suddenly, striking him. Safety manuals produced, no drug testing, they admit that was a mistake.

DOL 2019-10-23 They identify State Farm personnel in discovery? No responses re prior litigation, limited medical detail provided except that he was on an antibiotic. Client lives in FL. We produced financial info for Karen, her loss of income because she had to move with her husband is part of the claims, need to put numbers on all of this though. D pled nolo, is crazy and armed. Significant collision. D looks much more injured than client at scene. He claims sudden medical emergency, client told officer he had to stop suddenly.

Acute headache at hospital day of collision, MRI normal, back pain "feels like it's muscular," no Fx, no radiculopathy. Tinnitus maybe due to Rx (my guess)? Chronic neck and shoulder pain after, did PT, RFA, injxn. They contend not related. Cabot on review suggests headaches have resolved, he can't speak to the tinnitus, thinks that the sprain exacerbated pre-existing facet arthritis, possible causation of shoulder tear but he is unclear. We sent an OOS for $150,000.

Chaput answer filed 3/31 with no concerning defenses, last clear chance

RRG discovery - Robin Rich and Carey Rich? Chaput took photos, gave statement to carrier they won't produce, denies scope of employment but admit he was on the way to the office. Refuse to identify a safety director on relevance grounds. No drug/alcohol. Won't identify industry orgs. Won't identify procedure manuals. Won't produce work activity records, claim file, withholds portion of personnel file, all DOT stuff like safety files, etc.

Chaput discovery - he was turning with obstructed vision, client stopped in an unusual place. rogs are fine but he refuses to produce work activity records, etc

Get tape

NB HE WAS SUPPOSED TO CARRY 100K, NOT 25K
