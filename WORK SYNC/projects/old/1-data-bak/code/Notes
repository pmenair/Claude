* Rich Text

Org Mode does

#+begin_example
‘*bold*’, ‘/italic/’, ‘_underlined_’, ‘=verbatim=’ and ‘~code~’, and, if you must, ‘+strike-through+’
#+end_example

Superscript with '^'

Markdown is different in that it tries to be semantic, but ultimately similar, asterix and underline both mean emphasis, double asterix means strong, double underline means underline, strikeouts are double tildes. Markdown subscripts use tildes, org uses underscores, but I never use this anyway. Need TURN OFF the automatic font lock in org. I think I prefer org mode mostly, because markdown's attempt at semantics still feels like a lost cause. In export, pandoc exporter chooses <strong> for bold, <em> for italic, and <u> for underline, respectively, which seems right.

# TODO - fix problem with bold starting at the front of the line...

* Metadata

I prefer YAML to the fricking properties that org mode uses, Org let's you create YAML blocks but it's not clear pandoc export will recognize them. I guess I can live with Org, need to think about how it handles properties and whether there's a nicer way to do this with drawers.

* Footnotes and Links

All org links *except footnotes* are variations on [[][]].

The basic footnote format for org [fn:1] exports fine and as expected, makes html endnotes and latex footnotes. Pandoc export similarly makes endnotes. It's easy enough to move the notes (kill hr, make div if section) inside the raw html. Seems like too much work right now to make the notes automatically interleave with the text casetext style, and if I'm automating endnotes is a sensible default. Not tested, but I'm guessing this works as expected for epub export also.

Could try to make these look more like pandoc markdown by fiddling with org-footnote-re (see org-footnote.el), but this would likely be brittle and I'm actually okay with fn: style notes. But I made a font lock overlay rule that does it the easy way.

Just for history sake:

I tried playing with search links to roll my own, but this worked only in org and broke in html exports. If you must do it on the front end, you can do it set up plaintext superscript footnotes without linking, like this.^1

#+begin_quote
^1 Footnote goes here.
#+end_quote

Attempts to use internal links instead of [fn:] links work in org, but the exporters choke. If I really want to do something different someday, org lets you define extensions to the exporters, sort of like a derived mode.

Re other sorts of internal linkage, note that search by text links actually do work as fallback for internal links and not just file reference links, so you don't need to use those angle bracket targets as long as the text is unique. [[* Footnotes and Links][Links to headings] work but don't export right and require match to heading. Mostly I don't do this anyway, and if I did in a more complex document I'd be tempted to get into properties etc for better control.

These export issues with internal links seem like a [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20898798/in-org-mode-how-to-export-internal-links][moving target]] (pun intended), custom-ids are probably the only way to make this work.

[fn:1] the footnote.


And here is an example of an inline footnote.[fn:: Footnote text here.]

[[Overlays] looks for fuzzy match anywhere because org-link-search-must-match-exact-headline is nil., but I disabled it because it wrecks the export.

tl;dr ain't broke, don't fix. If you need a unique id consider using org-id-get-create to create a property drawer and populate it, but this seems like overkill for most of what I do. Look into the new citation system and bibtex.

[ ] TODO play around with org-store-link and org-insert-link, and org-capture, and org-protocol

* Overlays, Font-Lock, and Conversion

** Font Lock and Overlay

Building a system, including overlay of underlying org markup into something that *looks* more like markdown, which is prettier to me for some reason. Also a way to learn about font-lock and text properties, which are janky but powerful.

#+begin_src elisp :results none
  
  ;; markdownify headings
  
  (font-lock-add-keywords nil
			  '(("^\\(*\\)"
			     (0 (prog1 () (compose-region (match-beginning 1) (match-end 1) "#"))))))
  
  (font-lock-add-keywords nil
			  '(("^\\*\\(*\\)"
			     (0 (prog1 () (compose-region (match-beginning 1) (match-end 1) "#"))))))
  
  (font-lock-add-keywords nil
			  '(("^*\\*\\(*\\)"
			     (0 (prog1 () (compose-region (match-beginning 1) (match-end 1) "#"))))))
  
  (font-lock-add-keywords nil
			  '(("^*\\*\\*\\(*\\)"
			     (0 (prog1 () (compose-region (match-beginning 1) (match-end 1) "#"))))))
  
  ;; markdownify footnotes
  
  (font-lock-add-keywords nil
			  '(("\\[\\(fn\\):"
			     (0 (prog1 () (compose-region (match-beginning 1) (match-end 1) "^"))))))
  
  ;; light up todo types everywhere
  
  (font-lock-add-keywords nil
			  '(("Todo: " . 'font-lock-type-face)))
  
  (font-lock-add-keywords nil
			  '(("Follow up: " . 'font-lock-type-face)))
  
  (font-lock-add-keywords nil
			  '(("Event: " . 'font-lock-type-face)))
  
  (font-lock-add-keywords nil
			  '(("Deadline: " . 'font-lock-type-face)))
  
  ;; make lozenges
  
  (font-lock-add-keywords nil
			  '(("\\@\\@"
			     (0 (prog1 () (compose-region (match-beginning 0) (match-end 0) "◊"))))))
  

  ;; need to figure out a way to do this in the init file and make it mode specific, this just sets file-specific variables ("nil" does that). Note that to match the whole string you need (match-beginning 0), (match-beggining 1) matches a group. Also, compose region itself does not take regex and does this wierd thing where it piles glyphs on top of each other in layers when you have multiple characters. 
#+end_src

Todo: Automate font-lock-update. Figure out font lock for case names in consult-line results.

** Conversion

Conversion org to markdown works much better in ox-pandoc than the regular exporter, which converts to html and then does a lazy conversion to markdown that leaves a lot of the html intact. ox-pandoc is much better and gives a choice of styles. Would need to be turned on in the regular export menu (I also need to turn some stuff I don't need OFF), but you can
M-x org-pandoc-export-to-markdown directly.

* Lozenges and HTML

Didn't use a keymap, did an overlay on double @ instead just temporarily. Had trouble making this a keymap, kept giving me a dynamic expansion error like I was trying to make an abbreviation. Don't really need this anyway, yet, but eventually I'll adapt it so I can use it for inline html. See also [[https://github.com/tali713/esxml/][esxml]] and [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Quoting-HTML-tags.html#Quoting-HTML-tags][raw html quoting]].

# Should be able to do something similar to read in the xml, *write* to sql, and then play with the dataframe. Prefer to do this in org blocks over jupyter, which is a lot of overhead, albeit potentially more shareable?
