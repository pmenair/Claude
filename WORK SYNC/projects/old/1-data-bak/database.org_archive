Rotator cuff with medmal issue on treatment. Non-insurance Ds answered 4/7 with venue defense. Venue is wrong but per SKL they agree to stay in Fulton for now. Amended complaint filed asserting lost income claim. Tax returns and disability slips produced with medical, ORR, and photos/video - NB dashcam.

Medical: Went to urgent care with shoulder issue almost five months after the accident. $$ is lots of PT, then two surgeries.

Won't give up insurance claim file, does not have "ready access" to audits, doesn't have driving record. Lots of "no documents in possession." I think we're ready to do depos. Some objections in Progressive response as well.

Comp? 10/26, client no need to read and sign

SETTLED

[Hatcher] reschedule Progressive 30b6 - show them the video, get copies of certificates, photos, repair bill, Marquis Corp from D --> rss re Smith System, Truck Stop app, Marquis Corp, give them comp stuff?

Update lost wage, hourly rate, job sheets, wage and salary verification, update figure.

NB client memory issues at depo will be a problem, but I think she has a legit TBI, issue will be timing and credibility re the first accident. She had a not so great neuropsych.

Answer contains purported mtn to strike re citation, nothing else concerning except denial of liability. No add'l parties per em cherie@downeycleveland.com 12/08.  D alleges Rachael was speeding. Offer of settlement sent 2020-12-02 for 100k, client wants more than that. UM(SF) was out on Yarb, brought back. Discovery reopened as of 2021-12-02. 

She wants 60k net. DDS? SKL talking to treating. UM to pay 5k to settle liens? Request for mediation sent 5/19, no response. Discovery ran again 6/2. Stipped to trial.

spine and neck/back, they don't buy the concussion, did not treat immediately, prior accident (significant), similar injuries alleged, neurologist treated about a year after, no neck or back pain at initial visit, injections after prior accident, chronic sinus infections predate accident (including headaches, deny blurred vision etc), inconsistent discovery responses re neuro symptoms, jury will find defendant at fault, will see minor impact and not a lot of damages, will be difficult to show brain injury, no headache at the scene, no vomiting, and alternative causation re sinuses. memory etc will be explicable via aging and so forth, difficult to prove. No special expert medical evidence. Through Jan 2020 Sovereign Rehab 90% improvement.

Defendants answered 3/2 per extension (excepting Mahamet), probably a day late and ASCO was technically not included in the stip. We have a default against Mahamet, but probably no coverage. Izadine Mahamat non est, sent for service at new addr, service, default. UM out. Caprio out per amendment and leave of court. Answer to amended complaint, still with sudden emergency, no other concerning defenses. Denial of liability, more or less admits respondeat? Need to sort out experts. Discovery ran 3/31, extending. They have neuropsych.

Service on GAC 5/17, notorious on Hayes same day but not filed until 6/9 - everyone is served. They deny liability, employer denies scope, driver says he was on a personal errand, Heath said the collision was "no big deal." Low speed failure to yield case, he claims he looked both ways. Not a lot of damage in photos. Some documents withheld but I'm not ready to make a big deal of it. They want entity out. Client looks fine in dashcam, D claims he's out of scope of employment. UM out on Yarb. Client can't attend deposition.

Answer 2021-02-24 with denial of liability, no concerning defenses. Service only at mclaughlinelectronicmail@libertymutual.com. RFAs admit the citation but deny liability, contending that the driver of our vehicle stopped suddenly and without signalling. Responses are clean, no 6.4. No UM, $25,010.93 specials on a [NOT] TBI, mostly on lien. Last offer pre-litigation was $1,819.94 (only emergent treatment, they think the PTSD etc. is fabricated) Per skl we are not adding driver. Grandinette can't help.

--> client getting neuro and IEP, NON-PARTY PCP, need contract and substitute her as an individual (mom still has a claim)

D was disabled but got served notorious, Higgins agreed to withdraw service defense, but that was before the estate business. 60k+ with surgery, continuing treatment, last offer 8k bc claim unrelated. 

NB they are misspelling their client's first name. They are going to refuse to pay for the weight loss camp and probably not the surgery.

Discovery ran 6/2, per skl let discovery run, talk to client about her financial expectations, maybe talk to treating.

NB addl coverage for Mondays, punitive damages all Ds.  They claim they didn't overserve her and she only had a shot and a beer at the pub, tried to keep her there when it became apparent she was drunk.  D driver admits liability but alleges contrib.  She pled guilty to drinking and admits she failed to maintain her lane.  She is evading the Facebook question.  Client does not recall the accident, was not wearing a seatbelt.

Walmart denies liability, video slip. We have the shoes. Total hip. Client saw nothing on floor. Client and husband worked for Walmart. Service defenses as to the real estate trust but they admit WMS East controls the premises. We interviewed the Subway guy, he thinks it was the shoes, do not depose.

Not a great case on liability. Discovery ran 11/23, MSJ pending, not sure if we ever had a post-discovery settlement conf.

SOL 3/24. USAA has 100k LI, Progressive has 25k add on UM. Preexisting cervical, see 2015-07-16 MRI disc protrusion, but record confirms posttraumatic protrusion. Headaches and blurry vision post-MVA. Post-accident fall caused by sciatic pain. $21,894.20 medical as of 7/19, needs update. Per CS value at 35-40k. HOWEVER, surgical recommendation; he got bariatric surgery to lose weight for the back procedure. We made policy limits demand to USAA, their top offer was $32,225, litigation OOS 100,000. 

Other driver filed in 2019. Rear end, client was middle car, stopped for vehicle turning left. Vehicle total loss. Per default order discovery is damages only.

No OOS per SKL, work on the medicine. Floyd recorded statement produced. Per SC spine is related, not ocular, not good for tbi bc ETOH, psych, and lack of other evidence. Most recent neuro relates to spine per doctor.

Wallis v. Cotton States Mut. Ins. Co., 182 Ga. App. 147
Cherokee Ins. Co. v. Lewis, 204 Ga. App. 152

Re UM, interesting problem for Stephen

Discovery ran 9/30/22.
