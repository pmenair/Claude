PETITIONER DANIEL SPEAKS' AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE AND VERIFIED ANSWER, AND TO VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY, MONEY HAD AND RECEIVED, AND ATTORNEY'S FEES

COMES NOW Petitioner Daniel Speaks ("Speaks") and files his Verified Answer, Affirmative Defenses, and Counterclaims to the verified petition of Rebecca Susan McMillian (the "Complaint" of "McMillian") of January 15, 2021, showing the following:

I. Affirmative Defenses

1. McMillian's Complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.

2. McMillian's Complaint fails because McMillian lacks standing.

3. McMillian Complaint fails because Speaks had the consent of the decedent or the decedent ratified his actions.

4. McMillian's Complaint fails because Speaks was acting at all times as the agent of the decedent, within the scope of said agency, and without breaching any duty to the decedent.

5. McMillian's Complaint fails because McMillian has not pled and cannot within the framework of her Complaint show that Speaks acted in bad faith, was stubbornly litigious, or cause McMillian unnecessary trouble or expense, and because it is derivative of claims that lack merit.

6. McMillian's claim for breach of fiduciary duty fails because Speaks owed a fiduciary duty, if any, to the decedent and not to McMillian.

7. McMillian's claim for conversion fails because she did not have a possessory interest in the property at the time of the alleged conversion.

8. McMillian's claims for conversion and money had and received fail because she cannot within the framework of her complaint show that that she has unequivocally demanded return of specific funds with respect to which she has or had a possessory interest or equitable claim.

9. McMilliam's Complaint should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter, lack of jurisdiction over the person, improper venue, insufficiency of process, and insufficiency of service of process.

10. Speaks reserves the right to raise additional affirmative defenses pending discovery in this matter, including without limitation those defenses listed in OCGA 9-11-8(c).

8. Admitted.

9. Denied.

10. Denied.

11. Admitted. 

12. Denied as stated. Speaks admits that the decedent executed a will disinheriting McMillian on the stated date; no exhibits were attached to the service copy of this pleading.

13. Admitted.

14. The referenced provision of Georgia law speaks for itself.

15. The referenced document speaks for itself, although no copy was attached to the service copy of McMillian's pleading.

16. The referenced document speaks for itself, although no copy was attached to the service copy of McMillian's pleading.

17. The paragraph purports to incorporaqte allegations by reference and need not be separately admitted or denied.

18. Speaks admits an agency relationship with the decedent and further submits that the complex law of agency relationships speaks for itself.

VI. Reservation of Rights 

Speaks denies the jurisdiction and venue of this Honorable Court is proper with respect to the action brought by McMillian and respectfully requests dismissal. Speaks further submits that he has no compulsory counterclaims to a complaint against him arising from his conduct in his agency relationship with his mother. However, Speaks submits for the record that he believes that the Estate of Patricia Speaks has valid claims against Rebecca McMillian, and he reserves the right to raise those claims in the appropriate forum at the appropriate time, when and if he has the appropriate authority and standing to do so.

WHEREFORE, Speaks respectfully prays that this action be dismissed and that the Court award him his attorney fees and costs of responding to the petition pursuant to OCGA 9-15-14 or other applicable law.

VERIFICATION

DANIEL SPEAKS, upon being sworn, testifies on oath that the averments of fact in the foregoing Answer are true and correct.

MOTION TO DISMISS COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND FOR ATTORNEYS' FEES

COMES NOW Petitioner Daniel Speaks ("Speaks") and files his Motion to Dismiss Complaint for Damages, showing the following:

1. On January 15, 2021, Rebecca McMillian ("McMillian") filed a verified complaint in this court captioned as above and addressed as a complaint for damages by her individually against Daniel Speaks. The claim, essentially, is that Speaks wrongfully converted his mother's funds during her lifetime, and that McMillian should be entitled to recover damages as his mother's heir at law.

2. To begin with, said complaint should be dismissed for lack of standing as, under well-established Georgia law, an heir at law lacks standing to seek damages on behalf of a decedent absent a showing that the decedent died without a will and there is no administrator or the administrator consents to the action. Julian v. Brooks, 269 Ga. 167 (1998); Bowman v. Bowman, 206 Ga. 262 (1949). This action is, at the very least, premature.

3. Moreover, and in any event, this Honorable Court lack subject matter jurisdiction over the claims asserted in McMillian's pleading. Although it is well established that this Court has broad jurisdiction relating to the administration of a probate estate that includes claims for damages against fiduciaries appointed by this Court (see, e.g., Heath v. Sims , 242 Ga. App. 691, 693 (2000)), that jurisdiction does not extend to include any claim that a representative might bring on behalf of an estate; otherwise, this Court would be a proper forum for, for example, wrongful death actions brought by administrators under OCGA 51-4-5. 

4. The problem here is not just an issue of jurisdiction as a statutory matter. Under the Constitution of the State of Georgia, litigants have a constitutional right to venue in their county of residence. Ga. Const. Art. VI Sec. II Para. VI.; Here, McMillian has not properly pled venue exists against Speaks in Hall County and cannot do so as Speaks resides outside of this County.

5. Speaks also is entitled to service of process; McMillian has not properly served Speaks with process cognizable under the procedure of this Court or under the Georgia Civil Practice Act.

6. Johns v. Morgan, 281 Ga. 51 (2006), referenced in McMillian's Complaint, does not apply here. That case stands solely for the proposition that an heir at law has standing for the sole and limited purpose of seeking equity in the superior court to obtain an injunction to prevent waste of estate assets pending administration in the probate court.

7. This action plainly lacks merit and is improperly brought in this forum in an attempt at delay or harassment, without substantial justification, and in an effort to improperly expand the scope of these proceedings.

8. This conduct is consistent with conduct that has occured throughout this litigation. McMillian, through her counsel, has engaged in consistently abusive discovery practices, including the filing and maintenance of motions to compel without merit. They have conducted more than twelve depositions and have further depositions scheduled, including the depositions of both counsel for Speaks, whom they seek to call as witnesses at trial, apparently primarily for the purpose of impeachment. They also have engaged in the questionable practice of seeking document discovery from a large number of nonparties in every instance by subpoena duces tecum instead of by nonparty request for production, forcing Speaks' counsel to calendar a large number of custodian depositions, which they scheduled in each instance without consultation.

9. Accordingly, this Court can and should award Speaks his attorneys' fees and costs of responding to the petition, McMillian's motion to disqualify, and any and all unnecessary discovery, in an amount to be determined at the hearing of this matter.

REQUEST FOR EVIDENTIARY HEARING

COMES NOW Daniel McMillian and respectfully requests oral hearing on his Motion to Dismiss and for Attorney's Fees, including oral argument on his motion to dismiss and, if the Court deems it appropriate, submission of evidence on his fees claim.

PETITIONER'S THIRD REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS TO CAVEATOR

1. Produce your fee agreement with your attorneys in this matter.
2. Produce documents that record, reflect, or memorialize the time spent by your attorneys on your behalf in this matter, including, without limitation, invoices, hourly billing records, timesheets, and any and all contemporaneous time records.
3. To the extent not otherwise produced in response to the above requests, produce any documents that support your claim for recovery of attorneys fees in this matter, whether or not you intent to rely upon said documents at trial.

Dear Enrique,

We are, in an abundance of caution, sending you a formal request for documentation of your client's attorney fees claim. However, I am also by this letter, pursuant to OCGA 9-11-26(e)(3), requesting that you supplement your client's discovery responses in their entirety, but with particular attention to my client's First Request for Production #3, which requests production of documents your client may use in support of her claims.

She will appoint for limited purpose of selling the house.


Good afternoon, your honor. There are, as I understand it, two motions by Ms. McMillian and one motion by my client. I'm happy to go first or second.

Let me start by discussing their motions.

The motion to disqualify is premised on the fact that someone in my office met with the decedent and prepared a power of attorney for her on or about July 10, 2017, which was about two months prior to the execution of the decedent's will.

There has some confusion caused by the fact that my client recalled meeting with me for the consultation. That's not what actually happened, and my client, having had his recollection refreshed, will be testifying by way of errata that the person he met with was Mr. Leibel, the principal of the law firm I work for. I have that errata in hand and will be forwarding it to the Court reporter today. In any event, I was not the one who met with Ms. Speaks and her son in 2017, except very briefly for the sole purpose of notarizing a document.

Basically, Ms. Speaks and her son met with Mr. Leibel, briefly. He more or less immediately determined that this was a case to refer out to Mr. Pomerance, but he did prepare a form power of attorney for Ms. Speaks as a bridge measure to allow Mr. Speaks to assist with her finances while they sought Mr. Pomerances counsel. It's not a document I prepared or would have prepared, and I wasn't in the meeting. I have only the vaguest recollection of being called in to notarize a document that day, and I'm not able to testify regarding Ms. Speaks' competancy at the time, which again was about two months prior to the will, except to say that I don't believe Mr. Leibel would have drafted a power of attorney for someone he thought was incompetent.

The only think I could do at trial is authenticate my signature, which isn't in dispute, regarding a document whose validity is not at issue in these proceedings. When they take Mr. Leibel's deposition, he might have more to say regarding the circumstances surrounding the execution of the will, but all of it would be hearsay.

Now, Mr. Pomerance did testify in his deposition that he felt there were no potential issues of undue influence in the case at the time of execution of the will because of the existence of the power of attorney. But Leon's testimony doesn't really have anything to do with anything Mr. Leibel or I could possibly testify about in this case; what he was basically saying was he believed that Mr. Speaks had no reason to exercise undue influence over his mother because he would have been able to use the power of attorney to take her assets, he didn't need to make her execute a will. None of this makes my testimony or Mr. Leibel's testimony regarding the execution of that power of attorney necessary evidence at trial.

The law here is clear and fairly simple. A jury would likely be confused as to how to assess the credibility of a lawyer you acts as advocate and witness simultaneously at trial, so it's not allowed. This form of disqualification is not imputed to other members of a law firm, and it applies only at trial. An imputable disqualification exists if, and only if, the lawyer's testimony is going to contradict the client's testimony on a matter of substance. 

A few things to note about Georgia Rule of Professional Conduct 3.7. First, it applies only if the lawyer is a *necessary* witness, and the appellate courts have not in my reading of the cases shown excessive deference to the decisions of trial courts as to what constitutes a necessary witness. Instead, the admonition from the appeals court has been that disqualification should only happen where it is abundantly clear that the lawyer is the only person who could testify on a material issue in the case. I would suggest, here, that neither I nor Mr. Leibel have anything really to say about the probative issues in the probate cases before the court. 

There are better witnesses, including both family members and medical doctors, who can testify regarding Ms. Speaks' competence in both July and September of 2017. I'm not saying, at least I'm not saying today, that there's no jury issue on that question. I am saying that neither Mr. Leibel nor I are necessary or even especially useful witnesses to those facts.

The second thing to note is that the rule allows a lawyer to represent his client at trial *even if* he is a necessary witness, if the disqualification would work a substantial hardship on the client. Now, it plainly will work a hardship on my client to lose his lawyers at this stage in the litigation. 

Finally, again, disqualification is permitted only with respect to representation at trial, and the entire firm is disqualified only if the proposed witness is going to testify in contradiction to his client, which is not likely to happen here.

I'll move off of this and on to our cross-motions to compel unless the Court has any questions.

[Clough, malpractice, copy of file, Ct App overruled disqualification order bc other competent evidence]

The second motion I want to discuss is their motion to compel. They moved to compel us to provide a verification and some bank records. We did so, last week. They did not confer with our firm prior to seeking to compel the verification, which was a verification of a supplemental responses that I don't ordinarily verify. Perhaps that's wrong, but every time I've been asked I've provided a supplemental verification, and that's what we did this time, after they notified us of their concern by filing a motion. 

The second issue was a few pages of bank records that weren't included in the records we produced because they were missing from what my client had on hand. Mr. Morales asked for these on the morning of my client's deposition, and we couldn't provide them, because we didn't have them. I expected that they were going to get them from the bank by non-party request, or by one of the innumerable subpoenas that Mr. Hughes' office has generated, so I didn't follow up. If they had asked me to send my client to the bank to get a copy I would have, and in the end, after they filed this motion, that's what I did. They have everything they are trying to compel, and they could have had it without filing a motion.

Finally, there is our motion, which is a motion to compel Ms. McMillian to produce her tax returns. This motion I did try to resolve with them by sending a letter outlining my argument. This is an actual discovery dispute that we were actually unable to resolve by conference. They have attempted to mitigate the relevance of this material by withdrawing Ms. McMillian's petition to represent this estate and substituting a request for appointment of the county administrator. But I would submit that the issue we are proposing to introduce remains relevant at trial of the petition for probate in this matter, because it has relevant to Ms. McMillian's credibility at trial.

We intend to introduce evidence at trial that Ms. McMillian defrauded the decedent's disability insurance provider by making false claims for reimbursement. This information is relevant for potential impeachment of her credibility under OCGA 24-6-608(b), which permits impeachment regarding instances of prior misconduct such as perjury and fraud. As part of this investigation, we want to find out whether she made a false report to the IRS of her income relating to these payments. We believe this material to be within the scope of discovery in this matter, and we stand willing to enter into a consent protective order to address any concerns Ms. McMillian may have regarding her privacy or her husband's privacy.

So those are the pending motions, as I understand them. Now, it came to my attention just yesterday that Ms. McMillian has filed a new lawsuit in this Court making allegations involving the power of attorney more directly, which we will respond to in due time. I don't believe that petition is relevant to our discussion here today, and I don't think they have standing to file that lawsuit, but we will answer it in due time. 

However, given the number of petitions in play at this time, we might perhaps ask the court for direction as to how these matters will be tried, what discovery will be conducted, and so forth.

I believe we have pending a petition for probate, a petition for administration. Citation issued as to both of these petitions and timely objections were filed. More recently, a petition for temporary administration, and also a document titled a verified complaint for damages. I don't think citation has issued on the petition for temporary administration, but I was just going to respond to it as if it were a 30 day motion unless the Court has other direction. I'm not sure how a "Verified Complaint" for damages is handled in the probate court as to service, but if I can have 30 days to answer from some agreed date I will acknowledge service. In general, I think we've definitely reached a point where the Court's input would be welcome.

Good morning.

This is an interesting case, and I can say that with at least a little bit of authority because I used to specialize in estate litigation, some years ago, when I worked with the Gaslowitz firm. The facts are fairly straightforward. My client discovered that his mother was not being taken care of by his sister, took over management of her affairs, and made sure she was provided for until she passed. During the transition, Ms. Speaks redid her estate planning to disinherit Ms. McMillian. 

The caveator alleges undue influence, but my client will testify that this was his mother's wish, that it was initiated by her, and that he did not influence her. There are plenty of details to talk about in separate session. But basically, Ms. Speaks had a diagnosis, at the time of her testamentary act, of mild dementia. I think there is fairly consistent testimony, even by witnesses on the other side, that she knew who her family members were and that she was capable of understanding her financial affairs. The attorney who drafted and oversaw the executon of the will is an experienced and credible person who will testify that she knew what she was doing, that Mr. Speaks was not present during the execution of the will, and that it seemed to him to be what she wanted. 

So I'm not worried at all about much of what they claim. An initial claim by the caveator of improper formality of execution was withdrawn. Given the high bar in proving their claim of lack of testamentary capacity, I do not view my client as having much significant exposure on this claim either. Where there appears to be a substantive issue in genuine dispute is on the question of undue influence, and here, while I am very confident in our chances at trial, we do recognize that there is enough limited exposure to justify a pre-trial settlement.

There are a few additional facts worth mentioning. My office had limited involvement in the estate planning itself; we initially provided a power of attorney from Ms. Speaks to Mr. Speaks, about a month before the will was executed, and we referred her to the attorney who drafted the will. The other side has filed a motion to disqualify us as counsel and sent an email yesterday asking for our deposition dates, clearly in an attempt to use this fact as leverage here today. 

So I want to make a few things clear about that. First of all, I'm confident that we won't be disqualified. I can say for myself at least that I have only a vague recollection of notarizing a power of attorney and had no other involvement at all that would make my testimony relevant at trial, much less significant enough to warrant disqualification, which is a higher bar. I simply have no recollection of Ms. Speaks, for one thing. 

I'm pretty familiar with the law in this area, and I think we have the much better argument on the law, but of course anything can happen. That said if we are disqualified, I can assure you that Mr. Speaks will have competent counsel prepared to take this case to trial.

A couple of other things. First of all, it is worth noting that they intially filed a petition for administration by Ms. McMillian, which they have withdrawn to substitute a request for county administration. This is not a huge estate, and there would be substantial expense associated with county administration, involving the sale of a house and a fair number of collectibles. I think it's worth considering in discussing settlement that the county administration they seek would exhaust some significant fraction of the estate, on top of whatever we will be doing regarding attorney fees.

Second, it may be worth noting that there was a prior will, which we seem to have only in copy form, which was executed while Ms. Speaks' husband was still alive and names my client as executor. In that will the distribution between the siblings was 50/50. I don't think there's any argument but that wasn't competent to execute that will.

This is, in my opinion, an estate that should settle. We offered $50,000, paid out of the estate, which they declined. That offer is off the table for now, and the ball is in their court.Their responsive letter to us suggested that Ms. McMillian wants at least half of the value of the house, which is worth about $350,000, but it wasn't really an offer, so the ball is in their court. 

I would suggest that any counter from them needs to be structured in contemplation of the net value of the estate at distribution as opposed to just looking at half of the gross value, which would give Ms. McMillian an even better outcome than she would expect if she won this case at trial, which isn't much of a compromise. But I'll leave it up to them whether they want to start out talking about dollar sums or percentages. We're not tied to any particular approach, and there are any number of ways to approach settlement here. I expect that Judge Chastain can help us be creative in that regard.

Further responding, Petitioner submits that he simply does not recall whether he initiated a call to 911 on that day; the records of Hall County 911 will speak for themselves on the subject. Petitioner did speak with the officer who responded to the facility.

5. Please admit that you were never appointed as Guardian for Patricia Speaks.
RESPONSE: Admitted.



MOTION TO COMPEL

COMES NOW the above Petitioner Daniel Speaks ("Petitioner") and files his Motion to Compel, showing the following:

1. On November 16, 2020, Petitioner served Petitioner's Second Request for Production of Documents on Caveator Rebecca McMillian ("Caveator") seeking discovery of her tax returns and other tax filings, as follows:

Produce your personal tax returns and filings with the Internal Revenue Service and the Georgia Department of Revenue, including all associated schedules, showing your income from all sources from January 1, 2015 to present.

2. On November 20, 2020, Caveator responded by way of objection as follows:

To the extent that Caveator filed joint tax returns with a spouse, production of the joint tax returns would constitute an invasion of a spouse's privacy. Ledee v. Davoe, 225 Ga. App. 620, 484 S.E.2d 344 (1997). Caveator further objects on the grounds that the requested material is not relevant to the subject matter of the pending action.

A copy of said document is filed as Exhibit A.

3. Ledee v. Davoe, 225 Ga. App. 620 (1997) involved a broad request for financial discovery in a case where punitive damages were sought; the Court of Appeals held that in such cases some showing of an evidentiary basis for a punitive damages claim must be shown before discovery could be compelled. It is silent regarding spousal privacy and is generally distinguishable.

4. The discovery sought here is sought in an effort to establish whether Caveator reported as income certain funds obtained from the decedent's long-term care insurer as reimbursement for Caveator's services, which were subsequently the subject of a fraud investigation. See Deposition of Rebecca McMillian at 29-30, extract attached as Exhibit C.

5. On December 3, 2020, Petitioner's counsel sent correspondence pursuant to Uniform Probate Court Rule 7.4 requesting supplementation of this response and explaining that the material sought was relevant to Petitioner's petition insofar as it has potential relevance in cross-examination under OCGA 24-6-608(b), that it was directly relevant to Caveator's fitness to serve as an administrator of the estate under her own cross-petition for administration, and that it was information of ultimate interest to the estate itself. A copy of said correspondence is attached as Exhibit D.

6. The undersigned has received no response to said correspondence as of the date of the present motion.

7. The Court should compel production of the requested material and is authorized to do so under OCGA 9-11-37. The Court should also award the expense of the present motion pursuant to OCGA 9-11-37(a)(4)(A) or other applicable law.

The undersigned certifies that he has communicated with opposing counsel in a good faith attempt to avoid a discovery dispute requiring the Court's intervention, without success. 

NOTICE OF FILING DISCOVERY




Dawn Freeman Depo

Ms. Freeman, we met just before this deposition, I'd like to thank you for being with us today.

Have you talked to anyone in my office about the lawsuit we're here about today?

What about Mr. Morales' office?

Ms. Speaks was still a resident and still living when you left?

Do you know when Ms. Speaks first started living at the Phoenix, did we establish that?

Did you know her in September of 2017?

Do you have any way of knowing what her mental capacity was like in Septmeber of 2017?

Do you have an opinion about that?

Video timestamp shows June 3, 2019. Does that sound around correct?
At the beginning it says the sister was on a visitor's list, is that correct?

But she had not come to visit her mother prior to June 3, 2019.

The video we watched had a portion where you were visible in the video, then the officer stepped out and spoke with someone.

Where were you while the officer was talking the Ms. McMillian or the folks in the office.

What impact did the exclusion of Ms. McMilliam have on Ms. Speaks?

You testified that Danny would have had to have a formal guardianship to remove Ms. Speaks.

So it was your decision to remove her, correct?

And that was based on Ms. McMillian's conduct?

And, in fact, you intervened in an attempt to make the visit work, right?

Did you or anyone at the facility review any internal video after the fact?

Is there any chance that video still exists?

Do you stand behind the decision to exclude Ms. McMillian from the facility on that day. Why?

Corporate communicated with Ms. McMillian and told her she was not actually excluded, right?

Do we have a copy of that letter?

Do you know where we would get it?

Do you know if Danny ever obtained a guardianship?

Danny did come to visit Ms. Speaks, correct?

How often?

YOu heard that Ms. McMillian had taken her mother out over night previously?

From Jerry? What's Jerry's last name?

Would it have been intentional, not signing her out, or is that something she wouldn't have necessarily known to do?

What about the conversation in the office, were you a witness to that?

Where were those folks?

Were you a witness to that interacton?

Is today the first time you're hearing that portion of the tape?

In general, have you seen any of that video before today?

The letter from Ms. McMillian's lawyer references a phone conversation between Ms. Speaks and Ms. McMillian in May of 2019, do you recall that?

Were any restrictions placed on Ms. Speaks' ability to communicate with her daughter by telephone? At any time?

After the criminal trespass was removed, was there any limitation on Ms. McMillian's ability to speak with her mother?

How about in September of 2017, that would have been before your time, correct?

Do you know whether Ms. McMillian was able to visit her mother in September of 2017?

Did anyone else come to visit her?

Did she have friends in the facility? Anyone she spoke with?

Did she speak with you regularly?

If she had come to you with a concern about being abused or threatened in some way, what would you have done?

MOTION TO COMPEL, RESPONSE TO MOTION TO QUASH, AND REQUEST FOR EXTENSION OF DISCOVERY PERIOD

COMES NOW Petitioner Daniel Speaks and files his Motion to Compel and Response to Motion to Quash, showing the following:

1. In the course of this litigation, the caveator has served extensive discovery on non-parties to this action by means of subpoena duces tecum.

2. On September 17, 2020, Petitioner tendered written discovery requests seeking document discovery; many of the document requests would necessarily require the caveator to produce medical and financial records she has obtained from non-parties. See Petitioner's First Interrogatories and Requests for Production, copy attached as Exhibit A.

3. In response, Caveator claimed these documents were "privileged" and demands payment of some portion of the cost of obtaining these documents from the provider, plus an administrative fee of $100 per provider, as a condition of their production. See Caveator's Response to Petitioner's Request for Production of Documents, Privilege Log, and Letter of October 12, 2020, copy attached as Exhibit B.

4. On information and belief, Caveator intends to use some of these documents in support of her case at trial; however, she refuses even to produce those documents she contends support her case, citing work product immunity.

5. OCGA ยง 9-11-34(c)(1) authorizes a party to impose a "reasonable copying charge" where an opposing party requests copies of documents obtained from non-parties by the mechanism of a non-party notice to produce.

6. OCGA ยง 9-11-34 does not permit a party to avoid document discovery on the basis of an assertion that relevant documents which may be admissible at trial, which were obtained by subpoena and not by notice to produce, may be withheld pursuant to a claim that these documents are somehow privileged unless and until a payment is received.

7. OCGA ยง 9-11-34(c)(1) contemplates the imposition of a reasonable copying charge, not recovery of an administrative fee or amounts paid to providers for their administrative fees or the cost of obtaining and preparing a subpoena.

8. The Court should, pursuant to OCGA ยง 9-11-37, enter an order to compel Caveator to produce copies of documents responsive to Petitioner's propounded discovery, including any and all documents they may use at the trial of this matter, without charge, and to provide copies of any other documents obtained from non-parties at a reasonable copying fee, to be determined by the Court.

9. The parties have discussed entering into a consent agreement regarding the medical records that are subject to a Motion to Quash by Non-Party Northside Hospital; however, Petitioner is unable to agree to a consent order requiring Northside Hospital to produce documents to Caveator that she will not produce to Petitioner for a reasonable fee.

10. Petitioner is contemplating designation of an expert to provide medical testimony regarding the decedent's capacity to execute the document at issue in this matter, but is unable to do so without access to the medical records relating to the decedent. In anticipation that it may take some time to resolve the present dispute regarding those records, Petitioner also respectfully requests that the Court extend the discovery period in this matter, currently scheduled to conclude January 21, 2021, to allow for sufficient additional time to allow for the designation of experts and rebuttal experts, and the deposition of same.

11. The undersigned certifies that he has communicated with opposing counsel in a good faith attempt to resolve this dispute without involving the Court and that this effort failed.

WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully prays that the above and foregoing motion be granted, that the Court award Petitioner his attorney's fees and the cost of the present motion pursuant to OCGA ยงยง 9-11-37(a)(4) or 9-15-14, and that the Court grant such other and further relief as it deems proper and just.
