This is the deposition of the corporate representative of Ingles Markets, Inc., taken remotely pursuant to notice and agreement of counsel under the Georgia Civil Practice Act, with all objections except to form and responsiveness of the answer reserved for the first lawful use of the transcript. Are there any objections to any of that?

Please swear the witness.

Good morning. My name is Paul Menair and I represent the plaintiff in a slip and fall case against Ingles and Primo Water. I'm sure you've been well prepared for this deposition, but there are some preliminary things I'd like to go over before we start, okay?

First of all, this shouldn't take to long and it isn't an endurance contest. If you need to take a break, let me know, and the only thing I'll ask is that you answer any questions that are already on the table before be go on break, okay?

Habits from ordinary conversation die hard, but please try as much as you can not to interrupt me while I'm talking and give me audible, articulate responses, all that makes the court reporter's life much easier, fair enough?

You are here as a corporate representative of Ingles Markets, Inc., meaning that I am going to ask you to give true and accurate responses to questions on behalf of the corporate entity to the extent you can, do you understand what I mean by that?

If you do need to speculate or you want to say something and you aren't comfortable speaking with your corporate rep hat on, please make that clear for the record.

And sometimes, especially at the beginning, I will be asking you questions about you personally. Hopefully that will be clear, but if you have any questions about what capacity you want me to answer a question in please let me know.

Don't tell me anything about what was said in the meeting, but did you meet with counsel to prepare for today's deposition?

Who was there in that meeting?

Did you review any documents? What documents? Did you watch the video?

Is there anything going on today that might impair your ability to give me complete and accurate testimony? Your not ill, under duress, intoxicated, anything like that?

And you understand what it means to be under oath here today, yes?

Please state your full name for the record.

Are you an employee of Ingles Markets, Inc.

What is your position?

How long have you worked at Ingles?

Do you mind if I refer to the company just as Ingles, instead of Ingles Markets, Inc.?

Who do you report to? Title?

Who are your direct reports?

What are your regular duties?

Are you involved in the day to day management of the store where my client fell?

Were you at the time of her fall?

Continuing as to you personally, when did you first become aware of my client's slipa and fall incident.

[who told you, details provided]

Any information obtained separately from the initial report

Do you personally know of any prior incidents in the area of the store where my client fell?

Any incidents involving the Primo Water kiosk of any sort.

Were you involved in the response to this incident?

Did you take any statements?

Did anyone, to your personal knowledge?

Let's switch to questions directed to a corporate representive, okay?

Have you reviewed the answer that Ingles filed in this lawsuit?

I'll represent that Ingles admits that my client was a customer on the day fo the fall, is that still correct?

Does Ingles have any reason to believe, sitting here today, that she was there on any business other than shopping at Ingles?

At the time of the answer, Ingles was unable to admit or deny the absence of wet floor signs in the area where my client fell. Is that still the case?

Other than looking at the video, which we'll get to in a bit, is there anything we could do to figure out whether wet floor signs might have been set out anywhere in the store that day? Anywhere that might be in a written log, for example.

Okay, I'm showing what we'll mark as Exhibit 1 to the deposition, have you seen this document?

I don't see that this was ever verified, do you happen to know if anyone ever signed anything saying these responses were true and correct?

I'm going to go through these in some detail. I recognize you're not a lawyer, so I'll try to skip past those parts, okay?

Request 3 asks for documents memorializing the incident, and when lawyers say "document" they mean potentially lots of things. In response, Ingles identifies an incident notice, and I'll show you that in a secodn. Is there anyplace ELSE you know of where information about this specific incident might be preserved, other than the incident notice and the video?

Is this the incident notice.

Who is Blake Sosebee?

In the small print at the top there's a reference to a portal where incident reports get submitted, is that the correct way to submit these reports?

Do you know if they go straight to risk management or does anyone else review them?

Are these reported to people at the store?

This shows the date of the incident as 4/28 and the date of report as 5/03. So this was not reported on the date of the incident, correct?

Do you know what triggered the report?

Is 489 the correct store number?

It says medical care yes, but later in the description it says she refused help at the time but "she has been to the doctor" - did she come in later?

It mentioned she said there was a "light amount" of liquid on the floor.

What does "light amount" mean?

Was there any investigation of the fall at the time of the incident?

Photos taken?

There's a reference to "other witnesses" but only one is identified. Any way of identifying other witnesses?

Any way to confirm she was wearing flip flops?

Who wrote out the incident description?

Who have you personally spoken with regarding how the incident happened?

Who has Ingles interviewed?

What is Ingles position as to what happened.

Doe it seem possible that there was liquid on the floor in that area?

Liquid does end up on the floor in stores, yes?

Let's talk about store policies.

Does Ingles use outside vendors for any cleaing, inspection, or maintenance?

Do Ingles employees regularly inspect the floors for slip hazards?

How does that work, are there scheduled inspections?

If an employee observes liquid on the floor, how are the supposed to respond?

Let's look at what I'll mark as Exhibit 3.

Where are the cones located, relative to where this fall happened?

Where are cleaning supplies located, relative to this fall?

How is this policy communicated to employees?

What does a "routine check" mean?

How do you go about making sure that employees conduct "routine checks" of their field of vision?

How often are the supposed to do that.

We'll look at the video, but I'll represent there were what appear to me to be a number of employees with line of sight to where by client fell, am I wrong about that?

Any reason why they wouldn't have seen water on the floor in that area?

Let's look at Exhibit 4

This is a monthly inspection report.

How are these inspections conducted? By whom?

Is any of this relevant to a transient hazard like water on the floor?

This is not the sweep log referenced in the policy in Exhibit 3, correct?

We'll mark that Exhibit 5.

This shows initials entered when sweeping was conducted, is that fair?

And this is submitted to risk managment by whom?

Possible to reconstruct whose initials these are?

What does a "sweep" consist of?

What parts of the store are swept?

What equipment does the sweeper have?

Same time every day?

How long does it usually take?

So, if the incident happened at 5:45, it was potentially as long as an hour and 45 minutes from the last sweep?

Do we know what order they do the store in?

Any OTHER maintenance logs or records

Do you personally know about any prior slip and fall incidents in the area? Ingles?

Do you or Ingles know about any prior complaints of water on the floor in that area before plaintiff's fall

What actions taken after the plaintiff's fall occurred - people saw her fall, yes?

Was there an inspection of the area, photographs taken, cleaning or repairs performed

On Exhibit 1 at Paragraph 6, there is a reference to supplementation of photographs and video. Has everything been provided?

Were there any other reports, any other documentation at all regarding this incident.

Let's look at the video.

This is Ex 6

Have you seen this?

How was this preserved?

We have only short clips, is there some reason why?

Do you agree that if we had longer clips it might be possible to see how water might have gotten on the floor?

Is it Ingles policy to preserve video this way?

Walk me through how that happens.

Where is the actual video recorded and initially stored.

And then you send it on to risk management?

Could we get longer clips if we wanted to?

Is there no better angle on this fall?

Do you see any warning signs or cones?

Did you review the other clips?

Any warning signs or cones?

Let's look at Video 2, Exhibit 7

Do you know who these folks are?

Is this a video of people reacting to the fall?

Were written statements take from the folks?

Have you spoken to them?

Have you spoken to anyone who spoke with them?

Can you identify any standard response protocols in how these folks are acting in this brief clip?

Do we see anybody cleaning a spill?

Potentially the cashier is guarding a spill?

Other than folks we've talked about, can you identify any witnesses to the fall, any people who might know about the condition of the floor right there around that time, basically anyone else I might want to talk about.

Was there any investigation into cause of fall

What are Ingles' policies regarding responding to a fall? 

Anything in writing other than what we've seen

Does Ingles provide orientation or ongoing training related to hazards

Is there a safety team, meetings, campaigns or incentives

Are there any questions I asked today you were unclear about or you've changed your mind about?

Is there any additional detail you can provide relevant to this fall, anything at all.

Are the exhibits to this deposition documents and video true copies of documents and video maintained in the business records of Ingles, which were kept in the ordinary course of business by Ingles and produced in discovery in this case.
