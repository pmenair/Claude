_Assistant:_  
A **Daubert motion** is used in Georgia courts to determine if expert testimony meets reliability standards to be admissible as evidence.[1][2] Georgia law requires courts to apply the standards from **Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals** to evaluate expert testimony.[2] In 2022, Georgia extended the **Daubert** standard to also apply in criminal cases with the passage of HB 478.[3]

_Query:_  
what are the daubert standards

_Assistant:_  
There are four key factors that courts consider under the **Daubert** standard to determine the admissibility of expert testimony:

1. Whether the theory or technique used by the expert can be and has been tested - the expert's methodology must be scientific, technical, or specialized knowledge based on sufficient facts or data and be capable of being tested.[1][2] 

2. Whether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review and publication - while not required for admission, peer review and publication is a relevant factor in judging the expert's methodology.[1][3]

3. Consideration of the known or potential error rate of the theory or technique and the existence and maintenance of standards controlling the technique's operation - the court examines if there are standards to ensure reliability and determine the technique's potential rate of error.[1][3] 

4. Whether the theory or technique has been generally accepted in the relevant scientific or expert community - general acceptance can be an important factor in ruling particular evidence admissible, though a lack of general acceptance is not dispositive.[1][3][4]

The proponent of expert testimony bears the burden of proving admissibility under these **Daubert** factors by a preponderance of the evidence standard. A court acts as a "gatekeeper" in determining whether to admit or exclude expert testimony.

# The Daubert Standard\: A Guide To Motions, Hearings, and Rulings
The Daubert standard is the set of criteria used to determine the admissibility of expert witness testimony in federal court.

Under the Daubert standard, the trial judge serves as the gatekeeper who determines whether an expert’s evidence is deemed reputable and relevant. As such, trial judges employ a Daubert test to assess whether an expert witness’ testimony is 1\) based on scientifically valid reasoning and 2\) whether it has been properly applied to the facts at issue. Failure to comply with the Daubert standard can result in exclusion of an expert’s testimony.  
Due to the enormous consequences a Daubert challenge can have, it is important for any practicing trial attorney to understand how to execute a Daubert challenge, when to do so, and strategies relating to the execution of such a challenge.

## 1\) The Daubert Standard For Expert Testimony  
In 1993, the Supreme Court set the standard for expert testimony admissibility in the seminal case, Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Under the {++[Daubert standard](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/daubert_standard)++}, the court provided guidelines for determining whether an expert’s methodology is valid. The daubert guidelines consist of {++[five factors of consideration](https://www.expertinstitute.com/resources/insights/working-experts-understanding-five-daubert-factors/)++}\:  
1.	Whether the theory or technique in question can be and has been tested  
2.	Whether it has been subjected to peer review and publication  
3.	Its known or potential error rate  
4.	The existence and maintenance of standards controlling its operation  
5.	Whether it has attracted widespread acceptance within a relevant scientific community  
These criteria intend to prevent unreliable or otherwise “junk science” from being heard as evidence in an expert’s substantive testimony. The burden is on the proponent of the testimony to establish its admissibility by a preponderance of proof.  
## 2\) The History of the Daubert Standard  
Current daubert law primarily stems from Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, but is also deeply rooted in the two cases that came after Daubert\: General Electric Co. v. Joiner and Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael. Together, these cases addressed the appellate standard of review of a trial court’s admissibility ruling and applied the Daubert standard to nonscientific expert testimony.  
**Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 \(1993\)**  
In {++[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals](https://www.expertinstitute.com/resources/insights/the-history-of-daubert-v-merrell-dow-pharmaceuticals/)++}, the petitioners asserted serious birth defects were the result of the mother’s prenatal use of Bendectin. The petitioners had offered testimony about Bendectin causing birth defects based on chemical structure analyses, animal studies, and the reanalysis of previously published studies. The lower court dismissed the case on summary judgment, however, as petitioners had not established the premise Bendectin caused birth defects in humans met the “general acceptance in the scientific community” standard.  
The court reviewed the Frye Standard along with Federal Rule of Evidence 702, noting nothing in Rule 702 requires general acceptance as a precondition of admissibility. The Supreme Court effectively overruled Frye in federal courts and instead noted that when scientific testimony is offered, the court must assess whether the testimony is based on scientifically valid methodology. Ultimately, Daubert overrode general acceptance as the central criteria for admissibility.  
**General Electric Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136 \(1997\)**  
Just four years later, {++[General Electric Co. v. Joiner](https://www.expertinstitute.com/resources/insights/daubert-trilogy-navigating-standard-expert-witness-challenges/)[, 522 U.S. 136 \(1997\)](https://www.expertinstitute.com/resources/insights/daubert-trilogy-navigating-standard-expert-witness-challenges/)++}, a toxic tort case which excluded the plaintiff’s expert witnesses, clarified that an expert’s methodology should be the focus of the inquiry. Joiner held that while admissibility is not solely hinged on an expert’s ability to reach an accurate conclusion, it must nonetheless correlate with supportive data. Joiner also held that abuse of discretion is the proper standard of review of the district court’s expert testimony evidentiary rulings.  
**Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137 \(1999\)**  
Less than one year after its holding in Joiner, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in {++[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael](https://www.expertinstitute.com/resources/insights/daubert-trilogy-navigating-standard-expert-witness-challenges/)++}, a fatal tire blow-out case, to decide if the trial court’s gatekeeping responsibility under Daubert extended to “technical or other “specialized knowledge” \(as specified in Rule 702\).  
In Kumho, the plaintiff’s expert, a tire failure analyst, was excluded after the district court found the evidence did not satisfy the Daubert factors. The 11th Circuit reversed, holding that the lower court erred by applying Daubert to a nonscientific expert. Since the holding in Daubert, a split had developed among the circuit courts as to whether the factors could be used to determine the admissibility of other disciplines or expertise, such as economics, psychology, and other “soft sciences”. Because Daubert focused on the reliability and methodology of the evidence, some courts believed it only applied to strictly scientific techniques that could be easily tested. The Supreme Court, however, held that the district court was correct in applying the Daubert factors to the tire analyst, thus broadening the standards of relevance and reliability to cover all expert testimony.  
## 3\) Admissibility of Scientific Evidence Under the Daubert Standard  
FRE 702 is the crux of Article VII, as it guides the court’s analysis in determining admissibility of expert testimony. Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence makes no distinction between “scientific knowledge” and “technical knowledge” or “other specialized knowledge.” Under Federal Rule 702, persons that are qualified as experts based on knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education are permitted to offer expert opinion testimony if the following conditions have been met\:  
1.	The expert’s scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue  
2.	The testimony is based on sufficient facts or data  
3.	The testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods  
4.	The expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case  
The federal courts are all governed by the Daubert standard. Each state also has a Rule of Evidence defining the rules under which an expert can testify. In most states, this rule is codified as Rule of Evidence 702.  
{++[Some states](https://www.expertinstitute.com/resources/insights/daubert-vs-frye-navigating-the-standards-of-admissibility-for-expert-testimony/)++} apply Daubert, others apply Frye. Other states apply a modified Daubert or Frye Standard.

## 4\) The Daubert Standard vs. The Frye Standard  
## What is the Frye Standard?  
The Frye standard is commonly referred to as the “general acceptance test” under which generally accepted scientific methods are admissible, and those that are not sufficiently established are inadmissible.  
The Frye Standard comes from the case Frye v. United States, 293 F. 1013 \(D.C. Cir. 1923\) in which the defendant, who had been charged with second degree murder, sought to introduce testimony from the scientist who conducted a lie detector test.  
The D.C. Court of Appeals weighed expert testimony regarding the reliability of lie detector test results. The court noted\: Just when a scientific principle of discovery crosses the line between the experimental and demonstrable stages is difficult to define…. \[W\]hile courts will go a long way in admitting expert testimony deduced from a well-recognized scientific principle of discovery, the thing from which the deduction is made must be sufficiently established to have gained general acceptance in the field in which it belongs.  
The Frye rule held sway in state and federal courts for decades. It informed a number of federal criminal trials, and it also made its way into federal civil trials beginning in the 1980s. While the Federal Rules of Evidence articulated a different standard in 1975, it was not until 1993, in Daubert, that the Supreme Court held that the Federal Rules of Evidence standard differed materially from the Frye standard—and that the Frye standard was no longer acceptable in federal courts.  
As of 2013, nine states have declined to adopt the Daubert standard in their state courts. Instead, these states use the Frye or “Frye-plus” standard.  
## the Difference between Daubert and Frye  
Unlike the Frye Standard, the Daubert standard is a flexible standard. Under the Daubert standard, cross examination, the introduction of contrary evidence, and the court’s careful instruction regarding the burden of proof, rather than a bright line rule of scientific consensus, allows the jury to properly evaluate evidence.  
Because the Daubert standard standard applies in federal courts and most state courts, many attorneys are familiar with its multi-factor demands. {++[Surviving a Frye challenge](https://www.expertinstitute.com/resources/insights/how-to-survive-a-frye-challenge/)++}, however, demands attention to a slightly different set of priorities. In order for an expert’s testimony to be admissible under the Frye standard, the party seeking to admit the expert’s testimony must be prepared to demonstrate both that the expert has expertise in their specific field, and that the methods and theories they use to support their opinions are “generally accepted” in that field.  
## 5\) The Daubert Challenge  
A Daubert challenge seeks to exclude an expert’s testimony on the basis that it is not reliable or relevant under Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. A Daubert challenge is one of the strongest legal mechanisms opposing counsel can use to discredit the validity of an expert’s testimony, and possibly have it excluded altogether. Thus, executing a Daubert challenge against an opposing party can be the deciding factor in whether you win or lose a case.  
Daubert challenges can be made in {++[many forms](https://www.expertinstitute.com/resources/insights/successful-daubert-motions-best-practices-for-challenging-an-opponents-expert/)++}, including\:  
•	A separate motion  
•	As part of summary judgment  
•	A motion in limine  
•	As an objection made at the time the testimony is given  
•	In a post-trial motion  
An expert’s testimony can be excluded if the expert fails to meet the requisite level of expertise, if they present unqualified evidence, or if they use questionable methods to obtain data.  
## Types of daubert Challenges  
Within the confines of Daubert, there are several different areas one can challenge. Consider each of these potential areas of challenge in turn\:  
•	An expert’s qualifications  
•	An expert’s methods  
•	The science relied upon  
## Timing a Daubert Challenge  
Any litigation strategy involving experts includes considering the timing of a Daubert challenge. Technically a Daubert challenge can be made at any point in the case. However, it is wise not to make a Daubert challenge too late in the trial.  
Some courts prefer to handle Daubert challenges via a motion in limine. Others consider a Daubert challenge on its own. If the ruling is dispositive for one side, it may be appropriate to launch the Daubert challenge early, in connection with a motion to dismiss. While some attorneys choose to hold a Daubert hearing in the middle of trial, this approach has few advantages. It is less likely to result in settlement. Additionally, the court may issue a decision having given the issue less thought and consideration than if the court has several weeks or months to make the decision.  
## Challenging an Opposing Expert  
A Daubert challenge provides a practice run at presenting and challenging the evidence. This is particularly critical when communicating complex scientific principles, understanding what judges \(and, by extension, jurors\) will and will not understand can be invaluable. One word is consistently at the forefront of {++[successful Daubert challenges](https://www.expertinstitute.com/resources/insights/successful-daubert-motions-best-practices-for-challenging-an-opponents-expert/)++}\: methodology. When drafting any successful motion to exclude expert testimony, focus on the Daubert criteria and analyze the expert’s techniques. When you win a Daubert challenge, the benefits may include dismissal of the case, or weakening of the case for the other side. This, of course, may result in a more favorable resolution for your client. See more on {++[challenging an opposing expert](https://www.expertinstitute.com/resources/insights/keys-to-a-successful-daubert-challenge/)++}.  
## Surviving a Daubert Challenge  
When it comes to {++[surviving a Daubert challenge](https://www.expertinstitute.com/resources/insights/surviving-daubert-challenge-6-tips-success/)++}, the best defense is a good offense. This means that when choosing your expert, keep in mind the potential for a Daubert challenge from the very beginning. The best way to do this is to look for expert witnesses whose work will best fit the requirements laid out by the Daubert rule. Overall, throughout the entire Daubert process, it is important to remember the {++[goal](https://www.expertinstitute.com/resources/insights/winning-strategies-for-withstanding-a-daubert-challenge/)++}\: establish the relevance and reliability of your expert’s testimony. There are benefits to your client and your case, even if you lose a Daubert challenge. Many judges are loath to keep out expert testimony. Consequently, your judge may rule your challenge goes to weight, not admissibility.  
{++[Avoid Daubert Challenges. Connect with stronger expert witnesses.](https://www.expertinstitute.com/process/request-an-expert/)++}  
## 6\) The Daubert Motion  
A {++[Daubert motion](https://www.expertinstitute.com/resources/insights/daubert-motions-challenging-opponents-expert/)++} is a specific type of {++[motion in limine](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/motion_in_limine)++} raised before or during trial to exclude the testimony of an expert witness. Once a Daubert motion is filed, the party seeking to admit the testimony bears the burden of proof and must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the expert possesses the requisite level of expertise and the testimony is based on reliable methodologies. A hearing occurs before a judge and prior to trial. If the judge finds that an expert does not rise to the level of expertise required under Daubert, then that testimony will be excluded from being admitted at trial.  
A Daubert motion should analyze how the expert reached their conclusions, what methodology was used, and what was lacking in that approach to result in an opinion contradictory your own. Of course, the specific weaknesses of an expert’s opinion can vary widely, but generally speaking, there are certain things that should be analyzed. What testing did the expert employ? What is the rate of error? Were any controls in place? Was the data properly interpreted? Breaking down the expert’s technique and pointing out its weaknesses will naturally expose that their conclusion is incorrect.  
It is important to consider the timing of a Daubert motion. Several state courts create limited windows of time to file or respond to Daubert challenges. When possible, it is most efficient if the Daubert motion takes place after the discovery phase so the hearing is completed before the trial starts.  
Daubert motions filed before summary judgment rulings may pend longer than those filed at other times, likely because courts wait to rule on both Daubert and summary judgment motions at the same time. However, a Daubert motion can also provide judges with a more thorough understanding of the issues on summary judgment.  
## 7\) The Daubert Hearing  
A Daubert hearing is a trial judge’s evaluation of whether or not an expert’s testimony and evidence are admissible. Daubert hearings occur when the validity of an expert’s testimony is challenged due to the methodology used to form their opinion. Daubert hearings are conducted out of the jury’s presence and are usually based on a motion in limine which occurs before the trial begins. The hearing determines which evidence or testimony will be presented to the jury.  
Daubert hearings are not required for a determination that dictates whether expert testimony will be excluded or admitted. Any method of review is permitted so long as the court performs an evaluation with a sufficient record for appellate review, and articulates the reasons for its decision. However, Daubert challenges are important. If granted, they guarantee that the court will extensively review the admissibility requirements of Federal Rule of Evidence 702. Therefore it is essential to {++[properly identify when a](https://www.expertinstitute.com/resources/insights/successful-daubert-motions-best-practices-for-challenging-an-opponents-expert/) [Daubert](https://www.expertinstitute.com/successful-daubert-motions-best-practices-for-challenging-an-opponents-expert/) [challenge is needed](https://www.expertinstitute.com/successful-daubert-motions-best-practices-for-challenging-an-opponents-expert/)++}.  
A hearing occurs before a judge and prior to trial. If the judge finds that an expert does not rise to the level of expertise required under Daubert, then that testimony will be excluded from being admitted at {++[trial](https://www.expertinstitute.com/resources/insights/winning-strategies-for-withstanding-a-daubert-challenge/)++}.  
## 8\) The Daubert Ruling  
A Daubert ruling has the power to exclude expert testimony from the court and may lead to summary adjudication, which can make or break a case. The trial judge will have the ultimate say on the extent of the Daubert challenge. Most have previously ruled on Daubert motions, so it helps to investigate the judge’s record and determine if there is a correlation between the judge granting or denying Daubert motions. By educating yourself on the judge’s record, you can craft your motion to reflect the considerations that your particular judge cites when determining expert admissibility.  
# DRAFT

PLAINTIFF’S BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO EXCLUDE
TESTIMONY OF DR. NEIL NEGRIN AND/OR PARTS THEREOF

I. INTRODUCTION

The Defendants in this action hired Neil Nxx, M.D., a physician with general orthopedic experience, to evaluate the surgical treatment rendered to Plaintiff by neurosurgeon Bart Mxx, M.D. Nxx’s opinion testimony regarding the appropriateness of the cervical discectomy and fusion performed by Dr. Mxx should be excluded at trial for three reasons. First, the opinion is outside Dr. Nxx's expertise, rendering him unqualified to state and opinion. Second, he proffers no data or literature to support his opinion and relies on his own conjecture and mischaracterization of the record. Finally, his testimony is inconsistent and confusing which will not assist the jury. Nxx’s opinion does not meet the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 27-7-702 and should be excluded.

STATEMENT OF FACTS

Dr. Nxx reports, based on his review of the medical records provided to him by defense counsel, that Stephanie Bxx (“Bxx”) was involved in a rear end motor vehicle accident on Georgia 400 on February 18, 2017. (Neil Nxx, M.D. Record Review and Report Notes “Nxx Report” at 1.) {PDM: As I've mentioned several times, periods go inside the paren and "pg." is unnecessary. https://law.marquette.edu/facultyblog/2012/04/citing-to-the-record-in-briefs/} Following the accident, she was evaluated in the emergency department for neck and back pain and referred to her primary physician, Dr. Cox, who then referred Bxx to neurosurgeon Dr. Mxx for evaluation of her neck pain and radiculopathy. {NEEDS CITATION} Bxx’s subsequent treatment included surgery by Bart Mxx, M.D., a board-certified neurosurgeon, who performed cervical discectomy at C5/6 and C6/7 with artificial disc replacement on May 25, 2017. (Nxx Report at 3.) Following the surgery Bxx participated in physical therapy and by July 27,2017, she had “only slight pain in the neck and [was] making steady progress toward her goals.” (Nxx Report at 3.)

{PDM: Note I adjusted this to be clear that we are accepting Negrin's review of the record for purposes of the argument, not characterizing the record itself.}

Dr. Nxx was hired by Defendants to offer an opinion as to the appropriateness of the surgery. He is an orthopedic surgeon who renders medical opinions based on chart reviews. {CITATION NEEDED - note there are two defendants.} This activity encompasses 60% of his practice. {CITATION NEEDED.} Of that 60% Nxx estimates that upwards of 85% are for defense work. (Deposition of Neil Nxx, M.D. hereinafter “Nxx Depo.” at 16:1-5.) {PDM: "Depo." needs a period it's a defined abbreviation not slang.} Importantly, Nxx has never performed spine surgery. (Nxx Depo. at 22:1-22; 57:2-5.) He admits to performing only minor procedures. (Nxx Depo. at 7:17-20; 22-23.)

Nxx reviewed Bxx’s medical record and determined there was no support for a finding of neuropathy. (Nxx Depo. at 108:16-24; 109:1-8; 127:12-18.) However, he admits he did not review the whole record, including notes from Bxx’s primary care physician Dr. Cxx. (Nxx Depo. at 108:16-24; 109:1-8; 127:12-18.)

As part of Bxx’s evaluation, an MRI of the cervical spine was obtained March 13, 2017, identifying mild to moderate disc bulging at the C5/6 and C6/7 levels of her spine, along with mild canal and foramen narrowing and joint hypertrophy. (Nxx Report at 2-3.) Nxx reviewed the MRI and stated, “In my view of the cervical MRI scan reports, there is no specific evidence of an acute C6 or C7 disc herniation or nerve root compression to support the choice to proceed with two level cervical disc arthroplasty.” (Nxx Report Discussion at 6, ¶ 3.)

ARGUMENT

A. Applicable Standard

The admissibility of expert testimony is established by showing that the expert is qualified to render the opinion, that the opinion is reliable, and that the testimony is relevant. O.C.G.A. § 27-7-702, Cleveland v. Sentinel Ins. Co., 345 Ga. App. 795, 797 (2020). {PDM: I was going to scold you for using verbatim language but ended up deciding you'd departed to much from the language of the case. "Assist the trier of fact" is in the statute, but the three part test recited in the case ends with relevance. I know why you did that, but we need to color in the lines. I also deleted a bunch of stuff. You had some business about error rate, for example, that had an "Id." but wasn't supported by the case, and some other stuff that was repetitive. If you say the thing too many times in slightly different ways it gets confusing. I then added some stuff from your case that I think is more important:} Expert testimony is necessary in cases where a medical question requires "truly specialized knowledge," particularly in cases where such knowledge is necessary in resolving the issue of proximate causation. Id. at 798. Here, although Dr. Nxx's opinion is addressed to the key, relevant issue of proximate causation, it is outside of his expertise. It also is unreliable because it is premised on conjecture and mischaracterization of the record and because it is internally contradictory and confusing. {PDM: Restating the roadmap.}

B. Nxx’s Testimony is Beyond his Expertise

Special knowledge is necessary to be an expert witness and "may be derived from experience as well as study." Intra-Roto Inc. v. Guest, 160 Ga. App. 75 (1981). {PDM: Knew I'd catch you doing that. Verbatim material needs to be in quotes.} Additionally, our Supreme Court has stated that “[t]he pertinent question is whether an expert has an appropriate level of knowledge in performing the procedure...not whether the expert actually performed or taught it.” Dubois v. Brantley, 297 Ga. 575, 587 (2015) (quotation marks omitted) (quoting Deal v. Coleman, 294 Ga. 170, 172 (2013)). {PDM: Please compare how I structured that quote to what you had. Also, Bluebook for Ga. S.Ct is "Ga." NOT "Ga". Note that I move the Nathan cite also.} However, the scope of the area within which a medical expert is qualified to testify is not unlimited, and an expert must be able to show that he has actively practiced in the relevant field specialty. Cromer v. Mulkey Enters., 254 Ga. App. 388, 393 (2002); Nathans v. Diamond, 282 Ga. 804, 806 (2002). 

{I removed the 11th Circuit case. If you want it back you need to find a case that authorizes you to use federal authority in state court. I don't think it's necessary anyway.}

Here, although Nxx is a general orthopedist who does perform “surgery”, he did not perform the procedure he attempts to criticize, and special knowledge beyond general orthopedics is necessary to evaluate and treat patients undergoing spine surgery. Nxx admits in deposition that he has done only a limited amount of surgery (Nxx Depo. at 7:17-20) and, of that limited surgery performed, none was complex inpatient surgery of the nature of spine surgery (Nxx Depo. at 7:22-23). Importantly, Nxx has never performed spine surgery. (Nxx Depo. at 22:1-22; 57:2-5). Nxx can cite to no authority to support his opinions and admits that his study does not include neurosurgery, pain management, or rheumatology. (Nxx Depo. at 102:9-13.)

By way of example and of particular concern, Nxx's attempt to explain the indication for spine surgery is unsupported and, in fact, incorrect. Nxx states that the reason to perform surgery is to relieve pain, “not to remove discs, not to remove nerve root compression, to relieve pain.” (Nxx Depo. at 151:3-5.) However, the medical literature suggests that there are many reasons to perform a surgery including pain relief, correction of an anatomical defect like a broken bone, removal of foreign material and, relief of nerve root compression to minimize or halt the progression of neurological deficit. See, e.g., Kuo-Tai Chen et. al, Current Indications for Spinal Endoscopic Surgery and Potential for Future Expansion, Neurospine 2023;20(1):33-42, Table 3. https://doi.org/10.14245/ns.2346190.095

{PDM: I think this would be better with an affidavit and I'm not sure it's admissible on its own.}

Because Nxx is a general orthopedist who does not perform complex back surgeries and lacks the requisite specialized training and education necessary offer an opinion as to the appropriateness of the procedure performed by Dr. Mxx, the Court should exclude his testimony.

• Nxx Ignores, Mischaracterizes and Relies on Incomplete Data from the Medical Record Rendering His Testimony Unreliable

An expert’s opinion must be based on sufficient facts or data. O.C.G.A. § 24-7-702(b). “When the basis of an opinion appears wholly speculative or conjectural it must follow that his opinion is without foundation and has no probative value.” Swint v. Mae, 340 Ga. App. 480, 485 (2017) (stating that speculation and conjecture will not support a verdict) see also Layfield v. Dept. of Transp. 280 Ga. 848, 850 (2006). Additionally, medical opinion based on incomplete history or data can be excluded. Shiver v. Ga. & Fla. Railnet, Inc., 287 Ga. App. 828. (Holding that the Trial Court did not abuse discretion in excluding testimony of an expert when that expert’s opinions were the product of incomplete history.) See also Cook ex rel. Est. of Tessier v. Sherriff of Monroe Cnty., 402 F.3d 1092,1111 (11th Cir. 2005).
Beginning with the evaluation in the emergency department immediately following the accident after transport by EMS Nxx, with his detailed notes, avoids discussing the findings of that visit. (Nxx Depo. at 37:1-9). But he is quick to establish that Bxx sustained only minor trauma, again, without complete review of the record. (Nxx Depo. at 112: 2-7).
Next, Nxx is critical of the diagnosis and documentation by Dr. Mxx of the neuropathy in the left hand that was a driver for going forward with the surgery. (Nxx Report para. 1, pg. 7). In direct conflict and ignoring evidence, Nxx states “we know that there were no neurological deficits.” (Nxx Depo. at 75:5-11; 77:22-25; 78:7-10). The error of his position centers around the fact that he didn’t bother to review or acknowledge the primary care physician’s (Dr. Cox) record that was crucial to the referral to Dr. Mxx in the first place. (Nxx Depo. at 108:16-24; 109:1-8; 127:12-18). Curiously, whether intentional or not, this crucial data does not support Nxx’s conclusion that cervical surgery was not appropriate and is omitted from his report. When Nxx is confronted with this information he backtracks on his position regarding absent radiculopathy stating “I didn’t say she doesn’t have it. I just said these records don’t say she has it.” (Nxx Depo. at 109:17-25).
Additionally, when Nxx was asked if he would defer to the judgement of Dr. Mxx, who evaluated and treated the patient, his answer is “no, he didn’t have all the information I have”. (Nxx Depo. at 142:12-15).
Throughout Nxx’s testimony he mischaracterizes findings and data to bolster his conclusion that surgery was unnecessary and that Bxx’s condition would have resolved spontaneously given enough time. (Nxx Report para. 3, pg. 7). He attempts to discredit the care Bxx received by misstating facts and giving confusing and, at times, erroneous definitions and explanations of MRI results, the science associated with MRI, participation in physical therapy and, the application of steroid injections.
• Nxx Mischaracterizes the Science of Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Nxx, in his attempt to minimize the data, explains the science behind the MRI which will only confuse the jury. He states that the MRI is not “pictures” but, instead, “It’s just a bunch of molecules bouncing around”. (Nxx Depo. at 48:2-6; 65:15-16). Yet the images rendered on the MRI are indeed pictures (images) generated by computer analysis. https://www.nibib.nih.gov/science-education/science-topics/magnetic-resonance-imaging-mri
• Nxx Mischaracterizes the Interpretation of the MRI
Within his own report Nxx attempts to minimize the findings of the cervical spine MRI obtained March 13, 2017, which “identified mild symmetric disc bulge with mild central canal stenosis and mild left foraminal stenosis at C5/6 along with mild to moderate symmetric disc bulge with moderate right and mild left neural foraminal stenosis at C6/7.” (Nxx Report pg. 2,3.) He then states, “In my view of the cervical MRI scan reports, there is no specific evidence of an acute C6 or C7 disc herniation or nerve root compression to support the choice to proceed with two level cervical disc arthroplasty.” (Nxx Report Discussion, para 3, pg. 6.) After contradicting Dr. Mxx’s interpretation, he then attempts to qualify his position and goes on to admit that MRI is “sometimes inaccurate.” (Nxx Depo. at 48:2-6). He further misstates the written interpretation of the radiologist reading the MRI noting “in addition, there’s no evidence that there is any foraminal stenosis, except very mild.” (Nxx Depo. at 53:15-16) and admits to not actually reviewing a follow-up MRI. (Nxx Depo. at 66:1).
• Nxx Mischaracterizes the Physical Therapy Evaluations
Nxx attempts to color Bxx’s physical therapy result as insufficient to support the criteria for surgery. This is both mischaracterized and contradictory. He states that participation in physical therapy is individualized and even advises his own patients that they may need to change to a different therapist to achieve optimal results (Nxx Depo. at 60:16-22). But is then critical that Bxx showed a lack of effort and failure to participate in the therapy process (Nxx Depo. at 50:7-13;17-21) by focusing on a single entry in the record as support for his opinion that the cervical discectomy and fusion was not necessary. He then admits that by July of 2017 Bxx has “only slight pain in the neck and is making steady progress toward her goals.” (Nxx Report pg. 3) further adding to the inconsistency and confusion of his interpretation.
• Nxx Mischaracterizes the Lack of Steroid Use.
An adverse drug reaction is defined as “an appreciably harmful or unpleasant reaction resulting from an intervention related to the use of a medicinal product.”_ Adverse Drug Reactions_, Clin Med (Lond). 2016 Oct; 16(5): 481-485. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6297296/#:~:text=Knowledge%20of%20patient%20susceptibilities%20can,re%2Dexposure%20to%20the%20drug. These reactions are magnified when patients have multiple diagnosis, such as fibromyalgia and psoriatic arthritis as is the case with Bxx. Importantly, taking a careful and detailed medical history helps the provider understand the nature of the previous adverse reaction to preclude re-exposure to the drug. Johnathan R. Nichol; Joshua Henrina Sundjaja; Grant Nelson, Medical History, StatPearls 2023 Jan-. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK534249/#
Nxx states in his report that it would have been imperative to insist on the use of an epidural steroid injection and that there is no relevance to the patient statement that she did not get relief from steroids for fibromyalgia or psoriatic arthritis. He adds that there is no correlation to the use of epidural steroid injections for nerve root impingement for diagnosis and treatment. (Nxx Report para. 2, pg. 7). Two glaring issues arise with his statement. First, Nxx admits that he did not review the record to understand the context in which Bxx declined steroid injections (allergic reaction and failure on steroid for her Arthritis) (Nxx Depo. at 71: 22-25; 72:1-6) and advocates for ignoring Bxx’s experience with long term conditions and instituting a therapy in spite of the history. (Nxx Depo. at 87:9-19). Second, His theory that steroids cannot be used as a diagnostic tool in nerve impingement is unsupported. In fact, the literature would indicate quite the opposite. Kazi Z. Hassan; Andrew I. Sherman, Epidural Steroids, StatPearls 2023 Jan-. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537320/
• Nxx’s Testimony is Inconsistent, Unreliable and will not Assist the Jury
The contradictory nature of expert testimony goes to the credibility of the expert as assessed by the jury and does not render it inadmissible. Ouanzin v. Coastal Dental Servs., Ga. App. 168,174 (2020). But the proponent bears the burden of establishing that the testimony will be helpful to the jury. The role of the Court is to act as a gatekeeper basing its determination “on relevant and reliable evidence, rather than on speculation or otherwise unreliable conjecture.” United States v. Frazier, 387 F.3d 1244,1260 (11th Cir. 2004) see also (Bodner v. Thunderbird Prods. Corp., 2023 U.S. App. Lexis 3185 at 6,9). When the expert fails to meet these criteria established under §24-7-702 the testimony is excluded. Id. at 1272.
Throughout his deposition Nxx’s testimony is riddled with inconsistency. He states that Bxx did not require cervical surgery (Nxx Report para. 2, pg. 6) but then agrees with Dr. Mxx’s assessment. (Nxx Depo at 47:18-19; 152:1-4).
He places significant weight on the MRI result stating that the MRI is misinterpreted by Dr. Mxx (Nxx Depo. pg. 53:21-23) but then states “we don’t treat the scan we treat the patient.” (Nxx Depo. pg. 54:12-18). He then adds that the scan doesn’t support significant disc bulge, but the MRI is sometimes not accurate, (Nxx Depo. at 48:2-6), but we treat the patient not the scan.
Nxx’s interpretation will do nothing to aid the jury in their analysis and will only add to their confusion. As a result, the testimony fails the requirements of O.C.G.A § 24-7-702(b) and should be excluded.

CONCLUSION

Dr. Nxx’s testimony is riddled with inconsistency and fails to meet the standard established for expert witnesses under O.C.G.A. 27-7-702. His testimony is inconsistent, contradictory, and mischaracterizes both documented findings and the science behind it without referencing peer review journals or any authority other than his own anecdotal experience which is untested and not reproducible. Further, Nxx is attempting to opine outside his scope of expertise. His testimony does not aid the jury and is not reliable. Therefore, the Court should grant the Motion to Exclude the Testimony of Dr. Neil Nxx.
Dated this 28th day of September, 2023.
