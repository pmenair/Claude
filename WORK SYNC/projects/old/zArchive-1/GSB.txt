Governor does not want to touch it right now.
SKL how much $$ lost
- built and sold building, broke even
- bought equipment, broke even on sale
- lots of time in it putting application together
- 30-50MM value of license, maybe 100MM depending on size, look at other states, GA doesn't let you sell like other states do though
We didn't formally protest, only company that fit requirments
Some companies don't have buildings even today
Lots of ugliness behind the scenes
