Discovery reviewed, no 6.4

Client is a nurse with training in litigation support nursing. Worked
for Georgia Power as a nurse 2006-14.

Prior to that South Fulton Medical Center, coordinator of quality
management (peer review committees for physicians). RISK MANAGEMENT

Misdiagnosis of status epilepticus in 2012, delayed emergency room
treatment, but not able to continue working.

Keeps talking about failure to diagnosis but has trouble articulating
permanent impairment. Ultimately talks about memory issues, PTSD,
narcolepsy, depression. Later diagnosis with juvenile myoclonic [sp?]
epilepsy.

Keeps going on about failure to diagnosis. Prior dx was seizure disorder
that seemed to be related to sleep disorder. Lots of seizure history,
she wants to talk about this forever. Not a lot of seizures, never
interfered with her license because always over a year without an
incident.

Medical review:

Academy Ortho and Spine - not sure we have complete records, starts
2017-08-04 with reference to lack of improvement over prior visits. CT
treatment for back stuff that is clearly preexisting.

Trinity Wellstar - 6k in billing with no records produced a/o
2020-03-13, we do have some to produce

Wellstar Windy Hill 11,139 in records we don't have?

Midtown Neuro did injections, but it all looks preexisting

The rest is chiro, PT, and acupuncture

STANFORD DEPOSITION

This is the deposition of MARCUS STANFORD, taken pursuant to notice and
agreement of counsel under the Georgia Civil Practice Act for purpose of
discovery and all other purposes allowable by law. My understanding is
that we will be reserving objections, except to the form of the question
and responsiveness of the answer, until the first lawful use of the
deposition, is that agreeable? Would you like to put something on the
record about signature?

Swear

Mr STANFORD, my name is Paul Menair, I'm an attorney with Steven Leibel
PC and I represent MS. COWART in the lawsuit against you.

Have you ever given sworn testimony before?

I am going to ask you a series of questions. You are under oath. Do you
understand what it means to be under oath?

The court reporter will be trying to make a written transcript of what
we say here today, and it helps her if we try not to talk over each
other, okay?

Please let me know if I interrupt you before you're finished, or if you
don't understand a question, otherwise I will assume that you understood
the question and gave me a complete response. Is that fair?

Please also try and keep in mind that the usual noises and hand signals
and head nods that people use to communicate with don't translate very
will into writing, alright?

I am happy to take a break at any time you like, but if there's a
question on the table I will ask you to answer it before you leave the
room, fair enough?
