Status: Discovery ran, our depositions done, they would rather settle but may want to take the grandfather's deposition (he was driving the minor plaintiff). Minimal damage to plaintiff (under 3k medical?), good damage to vehicle, plenty of LI coverage in this truck case. We dismissed direct action defendant.

Dismissed Selective Insurance from the case. No answer from UM. He doesn't want to depose the kid, wants to take the grandfather if we move forward, needs to know about damages. Not worried about statute in this minor case, so don't worry about six month deadline to refile against Selective. NB PLEADINGS AMENDED per court order. Steve is not going to pay for scan after talking with Burns. Brandi is getting records. UM served 2019-02-15, no answer. Discovery DL 2019-08-22 per answer 2019-02-22.

Medical: Cervical sprain and unspecified head injury at ER. 12 yr, brought in by mother, head pain, no nausea, no unconsciousness, headache, blurred vision. Normal neuro exam, no imaging.

We have been told they have done all they can for the back, never going to be 100%. Lots of nice ice or heat. Just got her driver's license, nervous about driving. Always going to be different. Before accident never got angry, never irritable, personality changes, was at peace prior, ever since she'll have issues where she gets upset. Headaches and nightmares right after the accident, lasted for a year or more. PT an option in the future. Hid the pain because she knew her parents didn't have money. Trying to get through high school. Paid for all of it, but health insurance needs to be reimbursed. Traumatized her, they didn't have the resources to continue care, pay for therapy.

Mom just wants a little bit of money to pay for future PT and/or
treatment for anxiety
