PLAINTIFF'S BRIEF IN OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

COMES NOW Plaintiff Lenna Anderson ("Plaintiff" or "Anderson") and files Plaintiff’s Brief in Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment, responding to Defendant Rhodes Design Group, Inc.’s Brief in Support of Its Motion for Summary Judgment ("RDG Br.") as follows:

I. Facts

James Rhodes is the principal officer, sole employee, and sole shareholder of Rhodes Design Group, Inc. (Deposition of James Randolph Rhodes ["Rhodes Depo."], extracts attached to Plaintiff’s Statement of Material Facts Showing Genuine Issues Exist for Trial ["Pl’s SMF"] as Exhibit A thereto, at 7-8.) He is a licensed contractor specializing in contracting relating to the construction of amenity areas or "clubhouses" in residential subdivisions, with over twenty years of experience in that field. (Rhodes Depo. at 10-11.) He has a long-standing relationship with what he refers to as "SR Homes," the developer in this matter, and has built dozens of amenity projects for them. (Rhodes Depo. at 17-18.)

On June 10, 2017, RDG entered into a "Trade Contract Agreement" with Defendant SR Companies, LLC ("SRC"). (Rhodes Depo. at 19 and Plaintiff’s Exhibit 2 Thereto.) At the time he entered into this agreement, the construction of the amenity building at issue in this matter was nearly complete. (Rhodes Depo. at 19-21.) The agreement references a scope of work and bid sheet, but no such documents were ever created. (Rhodes Depo. at 22.) 

Mr. Rhodes’ understanding of his agreement with SRC was that he was to be a construction coordinator, ensuring that the work on the amenity was done on schedule and in compliance with applicable building codes. (Rhodes Depo. at 23-24.) SRC contracted directly with the subcontractors and specified and supplied all material; Mr. Rhodes’ sole responsibility, other than coordinating schedules, was to ensure code compliance. (Rhodes Depo. at 24-15.) In that capacity, he had the authority to direct the work of any subcontractors and order them to stop or redo work. (Rhodes Depo. at 25.)

The original specification for the breezeway at the amenity building in Churchill Crossing was for exposed concrete, and Rhodes ensured that this was installed with a "broom finish" that had an appropriate coefficient of friction to meet or exceed any code requirements regarding slippage. (Rhodes Depo. at 35-38.) Although Rhodes did not identify any specific code requirements in his deposition, his testimony was that "any floor finisher" would recognize this as the standard specification for exposed concrete flooring in an area like the breezeway at issue in this matter. (Rhodes Depo. at 39.)

When the gates to the amenity building were installed, Mr. Rhodes obtained the key fobs from the gate-installer and provided them to SRC. (Rhodes Depo at 84; Deposition of Robert Matthews [“Matthews Depo.”], extracts attached Pl.’s SMF as Exhibit B thereto, at 75.)

After the building had passed its final county inspections, a decision was made to refinish the floor to improve its appearance by covering up the concrete. (Rhodes Depo. at 46-47.) Mr. Rhodes’ involvement in the process of selecting a new flooring material was to communicate to SRC the requirement that the new flooring had to be "nonslip." (Rhodes Depo. at 48-49.) His opinion, based on years of experience in the trade, was that the applicable building codes and standards required flooring in that area to be "nonslip." (Rhodes Depo. at 50.)

New flooring was installed on July 20-21, 2017. (Deposition of Alan Mishkoff ["Mishkoff Depo."], extracts attached to Pl.’s SMF as Exhibit C thereto, at 34-35.) Sometime thereafter, SRC opened the amenity building to residents without consulting RDG and without obtaining a Certificate of Occupancy. (Rhodes Depo. at 52-53; Matthews Depo. at 34-35; Deposition of Stanley Gadjik ["Gadjik Depo."], extracts attached to Pl.’s SMF as Exhibit D thereto, at 69-70.)

Plaintiff was injured in a slip and fall incident in the breezeway at the amenity on August 14, 2017. (Deposition of Lenna Anderson ["Anderson Depo."], extracts attached to Pl.’s SMF as Exhibit E thereto, at 22-23.) She entered the building, passing through the breezeway, without incident. (Anderson Depo. at 29, 37.) Some time later, she slipped and fell while following her husband, who was wet from the pool, back to the restrooms. (Anderson Depo. at 38-39, 40.)

On August 15th or 16th, nearly a month after the installation of the new flooring, Mr. Rhodes went to the property to inspect it and discovered for the first time that the flooring had not been finished to his specification, ie., it was "slick" and "glossy." (Rhodes Depo. at 54.) On that same occasion, he discovered a homeowner on the premises and realized that the property had been opened to the public by SRC. (Rhodes Depo. at 54.) That homeowner informed Mr. Rhodes that someone had been injured on the premises. (Rhodes Depo. at 55.) Mr. Rhodes immediately closed the premises by padlocking the entrance with his own lock. (Rhodes Depo. at 55.) 

Mr. Rhodes believed at the time of his deposition that the installation was incomplete at the time of Plaintiff’s fall. (Rhodes Depo. 59.) However, the testimony of the floor installer was that the installation was complete, and there is at least an issue of fact with regard to that question. (See, e.g., Mishkoff Depo. at 34.) The floor installer subsequently resurfaced the breezeway floor to add more texture. (Mishkoff Depo. at 37-39.)

This action arises from Anderson’s injuries on the amenity premises and contains allegations of both premises liability and ordinary negligence. The present motion is a motion for summary judgment filed by RDG.

II. Argument and Citation of Authorities

A. Standard of Decision

As an initial matter, Plaintiff notes that RDG is requesting summary judgment only with respect to Plaintiff’s direct claims against RDG. RDG is also (and was originally) named in this action as third-party defendant by SRC, which alleges claims for contractual indemnification and common law indemnification against RDG, as well as breach of contract. (Defendant/Third-Party Plaintiff SR Companies, LLC’s Third-Party Complaint against Rhodes Design Group, Inc.; RDG Br. at 18 and throughout.)

RDG is entitled to summary judgment on the present motion if, and only if, the record shows that there is no genuine issue of material fact. O.C.G.A. § 9-11-56(c). Summary judgment is “an extreme remedy.” Watkins v. Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance Co., 113 Ga. App. 801, 802 (1966). It should be granted “only in cases in which undisputable, plain, and palpable facts exist on which reasonable minds could not differ as to the conclusion to be reached.” Indian Trail Village, Inc. v. Smith, 139 Ga. App. 691, 693 (1976). The routine issues of a premises liability case are subject to summary judgment only in cases where evidence is presented to the court that is plain, palpable and undispiuted. Robinson v. Kroger, 268 Ga. 735, 748 (1997). The issues presented by ordinary negligence claims, similarly, are matters peculiarly within the province of juries, and should not in most instance be decided on summary judgment. Mayo v. Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc., 302 Ga. App. 19, 21 (2009). Because summary judgment deprives a litigant of the right to a jury trial, the constitutionality of summary judgment depends on these limitations. Harry v. Glynn County, 269 Ga 503 (1998).

B. An Issue of Material Fact Exists Regarding RDG's Control of the Premises

Plaintiff has alleged that RDG is liable under both a premises liability and an ordinary negligence standard. On the first of these issues, RDG contends that it cannot be held liable under a premises liability analysis because it lacked control of the premises. Because RDG arguably had (or at least claimed to have) control over access to the premises, as shown, among other things, by its affirmative allegation herein that SRC should have notified and consulted with RDG prior to opening the premises, this argument lacks merit.

Pursuant to its Trade Contract Agreement with SR Homes, RDG was an independent contractor as opposed to an employee. (Trade Contract Agreement at ¶ 11.) As a general matter, a property owner does not delegate its premises liability duty to independent contractors and cannot hide behind them. R & S Farms, Inc v. Butler, 258 Ga. App. 784, 786 (2002). However, an independent contractor may become liable under the premises liability standard if it has control over access to the premises and the right to exclude invitees from access to the premises. West v. Briggs & Stratton Corp., 244 Ga. App. 840, 845-46 (2000), and McClure v. Equitable Real Estate Investment Mgmt., 195 Ga. App. 54, 55 (1990).

Here, there is an issue of material fact for decision by a jury regarding the question whether RDG had assumed control of the premises for purpose of the premises liability analysis. SRC had control of the key fobs and made the decision to open the premises. However, Mr. Rhodes provided those key fobs to SRC and put his own lock on the gate after learning that the premises had been opened, insisting, as he still alleges, that SR Homes had a duty to consult with him prior to opening the premises to invitees.

The West case, cited by RDG, is instructive but distinguishable. Although West similarly involved a distinction between a general contractor and a “construction coordinator,” in West the property owner retained control over scheduling subcontractors (West at 847) and did not delegate responsibility for safety on the project (id.). Here, RDG was generally responsible for managing the schedule of the various subcontractors and also for ensuring that all of the work was done to code and consistent with safety standards. Moreover, unlike in West, RDG asserted complete access control after Plaintiff’s fall by putting its own lock on the premises, and RDG alleges, even on the present motion, that SRC failed in a duty to notify and consult with RDG before opening the premises to visitors. These issues raise an issue of material fact here regarding which entity controlled the premises. 

Moreover, and perhaps more importantly, West is distinguishable in that it was a case in which summary judgment in favor of the premises owner based on the owner’s alleged lack of control of the premises was overturned. It is not a case in which the Court of Appeals found as a matter of law that an independent contractor should be relieved of responsibility; it appears that the case was returned to the trial court for a jury determination as to who had control of the premises, which is exactly what should happen here.

C. A Jury Could Find that RDG Performed It's Services in a Negligent Manner

RDG concedes that, regardless whether it had control of the premises, it did have a duty to perform its contracted for duties in a non-negligent manner. (RDG Br. at 10.) However, RDG insists that this Court should determine, as a matter of law, that it was not negligent. Its argument, in essense, is that RDG told the contractor that the flooring should have been non-slip, went to inspect the floor at a time when it had every reason to believe that the amenity was not yet open to the public, immediately noted the floor was non-slip, and immediately closed the facility. This constituted, according to RDG, "all reasonable precautions." (RDG Br. at 11-12.)

With respect, this is an argument for a jury, not an argument on summary judgment. There are contrary facts. James Rhodes apparently told someone that the floor should have been non-slip, but it’s clear that this message was ultimately disregarded, and it was RDG’s ultimate responsibility to ensure safety compliance. RDG also waited nearly a month to inspect the installed floor. Although RDG asserts that SRC should have informed it prior to opening the facility to the public, it’s unclear what that alleged duty is based on. SRC apparently believed that the facility was safe to open, and believe this at least in part because it had contracted with RDG to ensure compliance with any relevant safety standards.

Seely v. Loyd H. Johnson Constr. Co., 220 Ga. App. 719, 723 (1996), relied on by RDG, is distinguishable. In Seely, a carpenter drove a nail that, without him knowing it, pierced an unshielded plumbing pipe; there was contradictory evidence as to whether the pipe should have been shielded. Id. at 722. The Court of Appeals held in this case that he was not negligent and, in any event, could not be held liable because a subsequent defective repair of the pipe constituted an intervening cause. Id. at 723. The finding of non-negligence was essentially dicta, and involved facts entirely different from the facts at issue in this case. 

Davidson v. Meticulously Clean Sweepers, LLC, 329 Ga. App. 640, 646 (2014), another case relied on by RDG, is also distinguishable. In Davidson, the Court of Appeals affirmed summary judgment in favor of a de-icing contractor in a slip and fall case where the only evidence of fault was the mere fact that the plaintiff slipped and fell in an area where de-icing material was applied the night before; there was no evidence of improper application. Here, RDG expressly and without hesitation concedes that the floor as installed at the time of Anderson’s fall was, in fact, improper; moreover, Mr. Rhodes’ own testimony establishes that, if he had inspected the floor immediately after its installation, instead of waiting nearly a month to do so, he would have noted the hazard and ordered remediation. There plainly was a failure to communicate involved in the decision whether to open the building. However, like the issue of control, Plaintiff submits that the question of who should have communicated with whom, and how, is properly a question for the jury in this matter.

D. RDG Had Actual or Constructive Knowledge of the Hazard

Returning to the premises liability issue, RDG next argues that it did not have actual or constructive knowledge of the hazard at issue here. See, e.g., Robinson v. Kroger Co., 268 Ga. 735, 748-49 (1997) (actual or constructive knowledge of owner or occupier is a necessary element of a premises liability claim). Evidence of constructive knowledge exists where "the alleged hazard was present for such a length of time that it would have been discovered had the prorpietor exercised reasonable care in inspecting the premises." Washington v. J.D. Royer Wholesale Florist, 275 Ga. App. 407, 408 (2005).

Here, plainly, the hazard existed for nearly a month and was noted by RDG’s representative immediately upon inspection. The fact that RDG insists it was "reasonable" for it to wait so long in view of its assumption that no one would visit or use the amenity prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy is simply conclusory and presents, again, a question for the jury, just like any other question as to what constitutes "reasonable" conduct. Beard v. Audio Visual Svcs., Inc., 260 Ga. App. 476. 477 (2003) ("What constitutes ordinary diligence, under any particular circumstances, is a question for the jury.")

E. Plaintiff's Comparative Knowledge of the Hazard Is a Question for the Jury.

Continuing in the vein of premises liability, RDG next argues that Anderson’s prior negotiation of the floor is an absolute defense against premises liability in this action, citing El Ranchero Mexican Restaurant, No. 10, Inc. v. Hiner, 316 Ga. App. 115, 117 (2012). However, that case, like others in the "prior negotiation of the hazard" line of cases, involves an admission by the plaintiff that the prior negotiation of the hazard caused the plaintiff to recognize and understand the nature of the hazard; these cases boil down to the proposition that a plaintiff who has just encountered a patently hazardous condition and negotiated it plainly has superior immediate knowledge of the hazard. In Hiner, for example, the plaintiff conceded that she noticed the floor was slippery and that she attempted to take small steps to avoid falling before she ultimately fell. Here, to the contrary, RDG concedes that Anderson did not notice any problems with the floor and had no problem walking on it when she arrived that day. (RDG Br. at 16.)

Plaintiff concludes its final argument section with a somewhat unfocused attempt to convey the general argument that Anderson should have known the floor was slippery but also somehow is not able to explain what it is that caused her to slip. This argument contradicts itself and is patently disingenuous. There is no suggestion in the record that Anderson might have slipped on anything other than a floor that should not have been installed near a pool. James Rhodes testified that he knew the floor in a pool area should have been non-slip and that he recognized that this one was not non-slip as soon as he saw it. To the extent he had constructive knowledge of the condition of the floor arising from his contractual duty to inspect it and/or his control of the premises, that knowledge was superior to Anderson, who had no reason to suspect that the flooring installed near a pool in a neighborhood amenity building might be unsafe.

CONCLUSION

The Court should deny the motion and decline to award summary judgment in favor of RDG on Plaintiff’s direct claims against the entity. These claims plainly present issue for determination by a jury.

PLAINTIFF'S RESPONSE TO STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS BY MOVANT

COMES NOW Plaintiff Lenna Anderson ("Plaintiff" or "Anderson" and files Plaintiff's Response to Statement of Material Facts by Movant, showing the following:

1. At all relevant times, SR  Companies, LLC (“SR  Homes”) owned  and developed the Churchill Crossing subdivision.  (Deposition of Stanley Gadjik (hereinafter “Gadjik Dep”) at 22:6-14, attached hereto as Exhibit A).
RESPONSE: XXX

2. On June 10, 2017, SR Homes and Rhodes Design Group entered into a Trade Contractor Agreement, under which SR Homes hired Rhodes Design Group as an independent contractor to coordinate and schedule certain ongoing construction in the subdivision.  (Deposition of James R. Rhodes (hereinafter “Rhodes Dep.”) at 18:24-20:6, 23:12-16, attached hereto as Exhibit B).
RESPONSE: The referenced material does not support the statement. Plaintiff admits that SR Homes and RDG entered into a Trade Contract Agreement, a copy of which is attached to the Rhodes Dep. as Plaintiff's Exhibit 2 thereto and to Plaintiff's Statement of Material Facts (“Pl’s SMF”) as Exhibit A thereto. Plaintiff denies that RDG’s responsibilities under the Trade Contract Agreement were limited to "coordination and scheduling."

3. SR Homes gave Rhodes Design Group a list of SR Home’s subcontractors and told Rhodes Design Group which subcontractors to use.  Id. at 23:17-24:2.
RESPONSE: Admitted.

4. SR Homes obtained all required permitting and provided all building materials.  Id.
RESPONSE: Admitted. However, see Trade Contractor Agreement at ¶ 4(a).

5. Mr. James Rhodes, the owner of Rhodes Design Group, testified: “SR Homes did [the] takeoff.  They did all bids.  They gave me a list of all subcontractors to use.  I didn’t use any of my own subcontractors.  They dictated all that.  They issued all purchase orders, and they paid all bills.”  Id. at 22:4-13.
RESPONSE: Admitted.

6. SR Homes also obtained the certificates of completion and occupancy.  Id. at 64:6-65:25.
RESPONSE: Admitted.

7. Rhodes Design Group merely oversaw the scheduling of the subcontractors’ work and county inspections, and  verified all work was compliant with applicable building codes.  Id. at 23:17-24:2.
RESPONSE: The referenced material does not support the statement. The Trade Contract Agreement contains numerous provisions not mentioned here. Specifically, but without limitation, the requirement to oversee the work for compliance with applicable building codes was not a mere formality or a de minimis or irrelevant concern. 

8. Sometime in June of 2017 when the gates to the Amenity Building were installed, Mr. Rhodes received the key fobs from the gates-installer and immediately brought the key fobs to SR Homes.  Id. at 84:3-24; (Deposition of Robert Matthews (hereinafter “Matthews Dep.”) at 75:1-3, attached hereto as Exhibit C).
RESPONSE: Admitted.

9. After the Amenity Building had passed all county inspections, SR Homes decided it wanted to install a new  flooring system over the brushed concrete floor of the breezeway through the Amenity Building, which leads to the pool area.  Rhodes Dep. at 44:23-48:13.
RESPONSE: Admitted.

10. SR Homes hired The Garage Floor Coating Company, LLC d/b/a Granite Garage Floors (“Granite Garage Floors”), which it had previously used to install garage floor systems, to install the new breezeway floor.  Rhodes Dep. at 44:23-47:13; (Deposition of Alan Mishkoff (hereinafter “Mishkoff Dep.”) at 28:2-22, attached hereto as Exhibit D).
RESPONSE: Admitted.

11. SR  Homes’  design  team  chose  the  flooring  system  it  wanted  Granite  Garage  Floors  to install and issued the purchase order to Granite Garage Floors.  Rhodes Dep. at 47:21-48:13.
RESPONSE: Admitted.

12. Mr. Rhodes had no part in the hiring of Granite Garage Floors or in selection of the new flooring system  of the breezeway, other than informing Granite Garage Floors that the new breezeway floor needed to have a nonslip surface.  Id. at 47:14-18.
RESPONSE: The referenced material does not support the statement. To the extent that Mr. Rhodes attempts to characterize his responsibilities with respect to the floor installation, they are defined in the Trade Contract Agreement, which required him to inspect the installed floor and ensure its compliance with applicable building codes.

13. Granite Garage Floors installed the new floor system over July 20 through 21, 2017.  Mishkoff Depo. at 34:22-35:5. 
RESPONSE: Admitted.

14. Sometime in August of 2017, SR Homes decided to open the Amenity Building—without notifying  or  consulting Rhodes Design Group—even though it did not yet have a Certificate of Occupancy from Forsyth County for the Amenity Building.  Rhodes Dep. at 52:18-53:8; Matthews Dep. at 34:13-35:17; Gadjik Dep. at 69:25-70:9.
RESPONSE: Admitted.

15. SR Homes opened the Amenity Building because it believed all final inspections had been completed, even though it knew the Certificate of Occupancy had not been issued due to an issue with the subdivision’s detention pond. Gadjik Dep. at 67:5-18, 69:25-70:12.
RESPONSE: Denied. SR Homes distributed the key fobs to homeowners based on the mistaken understanding that a "temporary certificate of occupancy" had been issued by Forsyth County. Matthews Dep. at 17, 34-36.

16. SR  Homes had the key fobs programmed and distributed them to the neighborhood residents.  Matthews Dep. at 33:8-34:16.
RESPONSE: Admitted.

17. Rhodes Design Group had no involvement in the issuance of the programmed key fobs to residents.  Id. at 75:6-11;  Rhodes Dep. at 52:6-53:8.
RESPONSE: Admitted.

18. Plaintiff and her husband received from their key fobs from SR Homes’ employee Merrill Jett a couple of days before the subject incident.  (Deposition of Timothy Anderson (hereinafter “Anderson Dep.) at 10:1-24, attached hereto as Exhibit E).
RESPONSE: Admitted.

19. On August 14, 2017, approximately two (2) days after SR Homes had opened the Amenity Building for resident access, Plaintiff and her husband went to use the pool.  (Deposition of Plaintiff Lenna Anderson (hereinafter “Plaintiff Dep.”) at 22:24-23:5, attached hereto as Exhibit F).
RESPONSE: Admitted.

20. They used their key fob to enter the first gate into the Amenity Building breezeway and then again to enter the second gate at the end of the breezeway, which lead [sic] to the pool area. Plaintiff Dep. at 24:9-22, 28:4-17.
RESPONSE: Admitted.

21. Plaintiff did not notice anything remarkable about the breezeway floor on her way to the pool area and did not notice if water had been tracked into the breezeway from the pool already.  Id. at 29:12-17.
RESPONSE: Admitted.

22. Neither  Plaintiff nor her husband had a problem navigating the breezeway on their way into the pool area.  Id. at 37:8-14; Anderson Dep. at 20:8-10.
RESPONSE: Admitted.

23. Once arriving at the pool, Plaintiff swam for approximately twenty to thirty minutes before getting out to sit with another resident.  Plaintiff Dep. at 37:8-14.
RESPONSE: Admitted

24. After sitting for another twenty to thirty minutes, Plaintiff noticed her husband getting out of the pool to use the restroom.  Id.
RESPONSE: Denied. Plaintiff’s testimony was that it was 15 or 20 minutes.

25. Plaintiff’s husband was dripping wet and left a trail of water behind him through the breezeway.  Anderson Dep. at 18:16-19:10.
RESPONSE: Admitted.

26. Plaintiff testified, “He [Plaintiff’s husband] came right out of the pool, up the pool steps, and headed for the breezeway, right. . .Totally wet. . .Must have been [a trail of water following him].   It’s not that I looked down and looked for it, but it would have to be that way.”  Plaintiff Dep. at 39:4-16.
RESPONSE: Admitted.

27. Plaintiff followed her husband through the pool gate and into breezeway to gain access to the restrooms.  Id. at 39:4-16.
RESPONSE: Admitted.

28. She took a couple of steps into the breezeway and slipped, falling and injuring her right knee .  Id. at 38:5-13, 43:7-14. 
RESPONSE: Admitted.

29. On or around August 15th or 16th, 2017, Mr. Rhodes stopped by the Amenity Building to check on the installation of the new breezeway floor.  Rhodes Dep. at 53:18-56:9, 74:3-75:16.
RESPONSE: Admitted. Further responding, Plaintiff notes that this was nearly a month after the installation of the floor.

30. When Mr. Rhodes inspected the surface of the new breezeway floor, he determined it was not complete because it was still too slick and glossy.  Id. at 54:1-11, 75:9-16.
RESPONSE: Denied. The testimony of the floor installer was that the installation was "complete," and there is at least an issue of fact with regard to that question. See, e.g., Mishkoff Dep. at 34. However, Plaintiff admits that the floor as installed on the date of her fall was "too slick."

31. While at the Amenity Building, Mr. Rhodes learned, for the first time from a resident who was in the pool area, that SR Homes had opened the Amenity Building without notifying or consulting him.  Id. at 53:18-56:9.
RESPONSE: The referenced material does not support the implication that SR Homes had a duty to notify and consult with him regarding opening the amenity nearly a month after the floor installation.

32. The resident also informed Mr. Rhodes about Plaintiff’s earlier fall.  Id.
RESPONSE: Admitted.

33. Mr. Rhodes immediately informed SR Homes’ employee James Bagley that the Amenity Building should not be open.  Id. at 55:23-56:9.
RESPONSE: Admitted.

34. He then returned to the Amenity Building and padlocked the pool gate with his own lock to prevent key fob access to thereby ensure no more residents could enter the Amenity Building.  Id. at 55:23-56:9; 69:3-10.
RESPONSE: Admitted.

35. Sometime after Mr. Rhodes informed SR Homes that the new breezeway floor was incomplete, SR Homes placed rubber mats through the breezeway.  Rhodes Dep. at 61:19-62:14.
RESPONSE: Admitted.

36. SR Homes also closed the Amenity Building by “locking” the key fobs, so they could no longer be used to access the Amenity Building.  Matthews Dep. at 38:23-40:5.
RESPONSE: Admitted.

37. SR Homes controlled the computer software program that allows communication between the key fobs and the Amenity Building gates.  Id. at  39:22-40:5.
RESPONSE: Admitted.

38. On August 23, 2017, Granite Garage Floors returned to the Amenity Building to re-surface the new breezeway floor to give it more texture.  Mishkoff Dep. at 37:15-39:23.
RESPONSE: Admitted. Plaintiff further notes Mr. Mishkoff’s testimony was not that he "completed" the installation in August but that he re-surfaced and existing, completed flooring system.

39. The Certificate of Occupancy for the Amenity Building was issued on September 8, 2017.  Rhodes Dep. at 66:15-20.
RESPONSE: Admitted.

PLAINTIFF'S STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS SHOWING GENUINE ISSUES EXIST FOR TRIAL

COMES NOW Plaintiff Lenna Anderson and, pursuant to Uniform State Court Rule 6.5, files her Statement of Material Facts Showing Genuine Issues Exist for Trial,showing the following:

1. James Rhodes is the principal officer, sole employee, and sole shareholder of Rhodes Design Group, Inc. (Deposition of James Randolph Rhodes ["Rhodes Depo."], extracts attached as Exhibit A hereto, at 7-8.) 

2. James Rhodes is a licensed contractor specializing in contracting relating to the construction of amenity areas or "clubhouses" in residential subdivisions, with over twenty years of experience in that field. (Rhodes Depo. at 10-11.) 

3. James Rhodes has a long-standing relationship with what he refers to as "SR Homes," the developer in this matter, and has built dozens of amenity projects for them. (Rhodes Depo. at 17-18.)

4. On June 10, 2017, Rhodes Design Group, Inc. ("RDG") entered into a "Trade Contract Agreement" with Defendant SR Companies, LLC ("SRC"). (Rhodes Depo. at 19 and Plaintiff’s Exhibit 2 Thereto.) 

5. At the time RDG entered into this agreement, the construction of the amenity building at issue in this matter was nearly complete. (Rhodes Depo. at 19-21.)

6. The Trade Contract Agreement references a scope of work and bid sheet, but no such documents were ever created. (Rhodes Depo. at 22.) 

7. Mr. Rhodes’ understanding of his agreement with SRC was that he was to be a construction coordinator, ensuring that the work on the amenity was done on schedule and in compliance with applicable building codes. (Rhodes Depo. at 23-24.) 

8. SRC contracted directly with the subcontractors and specified and supplied all material; Mr. Rhodes’ sole responsibility, other than coordinating schedules, was to ensure code compliance. (Rhodes Depo. at 24-15.) 

9. In his capacity as construction coordinator, Mr. Rhodes had the authority to direct the work of any subcontractors and order them to stop or redo work. (Rhodes Depo. at 25.)

10. The original specification for the breezeway at the amenity building in Churchill Crossing was for exposed concrete, and Rhodes ensured that this was installed with a "broom finish" that had an appropriate coefficient of friction to meet or exceed any code requirements regarding slippage. (Rhodes Depo. at 35-38.) 

11. Although Rhodes did not identify any specific code requirements in his deposition, his testimony was that "any floor finisher" would recognize this as the standard specification for exposed concrete flooring in an area like the breezeway at issue in this matter. (Rhodes Depo. at 39.)

12. When the gates to the amenity building were installed, Mr. Rhodes obtained the key fobs from the gate-installer and provided them to SRC. (Rhodes Depo at 84; Deposition of Robert Matthews [“Matthews Depo.”], extracts attached as Exhibit B hereto, at 75.)

13. After the building had passed its final county inspections, a decision was made to refinish the floor to improve its appearance by covering up the concrete. (Rhodes Depo. at 46-47.) 

14. Mr. Rhodes’ involvement in the process of selecting a new flooring material was to communicate to SRC the requirement that the new flooring had to be "nonslip." (Rhodes Depo. at 48-49.) 

15. Mr. Rhodes’ opinion, based on years of experience in the trade, was that the applicable building codes and standards required flooring in that area to be "nonslip." (Rhodes Depo. at 50.)

16. New flooring was installed on July 20-21, 2017. (Deposition of Alan Mishkoff ["Mishkoff Depo."], extracts attached to as Exhibit C hereto, at 34-35.) 

17. Sometime after July 21, SRC opened the amenity building to residents without consulting RDG and without obtaining a Certificate of Occupancy. (Rhodes Depo. at 52-53; Matthews Depo. at 34-35; Deposition of Stanley Gadjik ["Gadjik Depo."], extracts attached as Exhibit D hereto, at 69-70.)

18. Plaintiff was injured in a slip and fall incident in the breezeway at the amenity on August 14, 2017. (Deposition of Lenna Anderson ["Anderson Depo."], extracts attached as Exhibit E hereto, at 22-23.) 

19. Plaintiff entered the building, passing through the breezeway, without incident. (Anderson Depo. at 29, 37.) 

20. Some time later, Plaintiff slipped and fell while following her husband, who was wet from the pool, back to the restrooms. (Anderson Depo. at 38-39, 40.)

21. On August 15th or 16th, nearly a month after the installation of the new flooring, Mr. Rhodes went to the property to inspect it and discovered for the first time that the flooring had not been finished to his specification, ie., it was "slick" and "glossy." (Rhodes Depo. at 54.) 

22. On that same occasion, Mr. Rhodes discovered a homeowner on the premises and realized that the property had been opened to the public by SRC. (Rhodes Depo. at 54.) 

23. That homeowner informed Mr. Rhodes that someone had been injured on the premises. (Rhodes Depo. at 55.) 

24. Mr. Rhodes immediately closed the premises by padlocking the entrance with his own lock. (Rhodes Depo. at 55.) 

25. Mr. Rhodes believed at the time of his deposition that the installation was incomplete at the time of Plaintiff’s fall. (Rhodes Depo. 59.) 

26. However, the testimony of the floor installer was that the installation was complete, and there is at least an issue of fact with regard to that question. (See, e.g., Mishkoff Depo. at 34.) 

27. The floor installer subsequently resurfaced the breezeway floor to add more texture. (Mishkoff Depo. at 37-39.)

Note that SR is selling homes, not just an HOA. (actually I think the
invitee business is not as clear as I originally feared)

DOL 2017-08-18

Slip and fall at pool in amenity area. Client had knee fracture, $46,694.20 medical as of 2019-06-19 (client was no longer treating on that date), no lost wages (retired). Medicare. Plenty of coverage, we sent demands for 750,000 to State Farm, EMC, and Farmers. Pool area was opened early per client, key fobs distributed from SR offices, SR still had control of the amenities, definitely not the HOA. Project manager (Rhodes) did not know the amenities were open, Contractor claims it did not know floor was supposed to be non-slip.

Per client "Merrill Jett had key fobs," Merrill was someone from SR,
then they went to Patty Swann in the sales office and she fixed it so
the fobs would work.
