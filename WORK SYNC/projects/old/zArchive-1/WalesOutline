Please introduce yourself to the Court [Jordon Wales / Lee Walker]

Tell me a little bit about yourself

Are you a licensed plumber?

Do you work for a company?

Is North Georgia Rooter a DBA or an LLC?

Did ever have occasion to do plumbing work for Richard and Sherrie Thurgood, the plaintiffs in this case?

And when I say you, do you to the work personally, or as an employee of North Georgia Rooter, LLC?

Why did you form a limited liability company?

When you formed the company, did you have the expectation that it would limit your liability to customers?

Tell me about how you started work for Mr. Thurgood

Did you ever deal with Sherrie Thurgood? Have you met her?

What did he communicate to you as the scope of work?

I'm showing you a two page document marked as Exhibit 1

Can you tell me what this is?

Was it produced in the ordinary course of business by NGR, LLC

I'd like to tender this as Exhibit 1

Please walk me through the two pages and what they tell us about the initial scope of work.

Did you pull a permit.

Why not?

Are you, as a plumber, obligated to pull a permit for a job like this, or is that up to the homeowner?

Let's look at what I've marked as Exhibit 2

Please tell me about this exhibit.

So this is a record of communications between North Georgia Rooter and Mr. Thurgood during the job, correct?

I'd like to tender this as well.

You can use it to refresh your recollection

Tell me about your first day on the job.

What happened next

[walk through narrative]

Let's look at Exhibit 3

When did you receive this letter?

Do you have any reason to doubt that's Mr. Thurgood's signature

Tender 3

1. 6 inch height difference in vanity supply lines

[Due to the framing of the wall, would have been covered up with finish and carpentry]

2. toilet drain not perpendicular

[would have been trimmed out]

3. shower valve not secured, off center, screw sticking out

[pre-existing tub, replaced shower valve, needed a longer screw to secure, customer knew about the screw and was going to cut it off during finish work.]

4. drain lines bent, not cut

[unclear what this means, I mean it's three inch PVC drain, you can't bend it. Everything water tested.]

5. fittings instead of glue

[limited space and changes, fittings absolutely to code and completely secure.]

6. pooling shower drain

[fiberglass pool, not an install issue.]

7. PVC vent cut

[Other workers in there, also found other peoples nails, everything was fixed]

8. cleanup

[SOP to leave small trash piles during rough.

9. toilet supply line too close, toilet drain cut, toilet not level

[trim work - they had a temporary toilet working for Ms. Thurgood to use so she wouldn't have to go downstairs]

11. no vanity shut off, no drain lines

[trim work]

12. no toilet drain, flange or toilet main powder

[trim work]

13. improper routing in basement, no shut offs, drain not as high as it could go [basement ceiling]

[all done properly and level to the ceiling as possible, drain needs pitch]

15. splices

[Lots of change work, splices done to code.]

16. mortar drilling

[50 yo house, he knew they aren't masons]

17. relief line and drain pan for water heater

[existing water heater on basement floor, would have been outside the scope and additional expense to install, customer declined.

18. Lee walked off the job.

[Customer was abusive]

Let me show you what's marked as Exhibit 4

Tell me about this letter.

So, looking back at Exhibit 1, this first page is the actual invoice for the work you performed, and the second page was your estimate.

So your position, sitting here today, is that Mr. Thurgood owes North Georgia Rooter, LLC how much? [1,099.92]

And is that without the trim work that wasn't done?

How much do you estimate they would have had to pay to finish the job, with the changes and unanticipated work?

Did you ever promise Mr. Thurgood to do the entire job, including any change work, for a flat rate of $10,500?
