Ban Van Nguyen v. Yannick Earle-Drue, Cesar's Trucking, LLC, and
American Family Insurance Company, State Court of Gwinnett County, Civil
Action No.Â 18C02794-5, J. Pamela D. South.

Trucking case held up due to continuing medical, surgery probably not related, discovery ran
2020-08-12 per extension. Medical needs to be looked at but was $43,421.49 pre surgery, top offer pre-lit was $33,700. Client wants lots of money. Per mediation, we are at 475k, they are at 65k, Joffe doesn't think the adjuster will go over 100. Offer of settlement? Dismiss and refile in better jxn?

blind spot

/Notes/

Look at commercial definition of following too closely, "so as to enable
any other vehicle to enter and occupy such space"

(((Dismiss and refile in DeKalb)) NB new
address for Jennifer Miller

Client has complex medical history, causation issues; records show pain
generated probably by spinal stenosis with nerve compression, but
potentially diabetic neuropathy is involved as well. Multiple accidents.

--> Rss re punitives? Call other drivers?

Appearances: Answers filed for Earle-Drue and Cesar's (2018-05-07),
American Family (2018-05-16), and UM. OCN Adam C. Joffe Goodman McGuffey
LLP for driver and Earle-Drue. Jennifer Miller answered for American
Family asserting a joinder defense, but I spoke with her and she told me
that's just because there may have been other vehicles in the accident.
Kenneth Sisco answered for the UM. No concerning defenses. Jennifer
Miller cell 470-270-3759 American Family Insurance.

Medical: We demanded in complaint $31,001.14 past and future medicals
plus general damages for past and future pain and suffering. Medical as
of 2019-10-02 was $43,421.49. NEGMC records show pain in upper back and
abdomen, left knee. CT head shows some issues likely unrelated. CT and
MRI spine shows degenerative changes, nothing acute. Chest and abdomen
also clear. Dx cervical strain. Longstreet clinic records show emergence
of low back and neck pain, Rx PT. Most of the $$ is the initial hospital
visit. He has preexisting back, AND a prior accident. We have a bill but
no records from EMS.

Negotiation: Demand letter asking for $100,000 sent to LI insurer
American Family; they have 1 million, their top offer pre-lit was
$33,700. UM Mid-Century Insurance Company has $50,000 reduced by at
fault, they are out via Yarborough. There's a Medicare lien.

Liability: Driver was cited for improper lane change in accident. They
deny liability. In RFAs, company admits that driver was acting under
authority of their DOT number but denies responsibility for him and
denies duty of care in entrusting the vehicle to him. Driver admits
citation but denies both guilt and liability.

Discovery: Discovery responses from both driver and company served July
2, no basis for 6.4 per my review. EXCEPT: they refuse to provide
medical documents, contending not at issue. Discussed at deposition.
Many documents not produced, probably don't exist. Depositions
conducted, per SKL no need for expert.

Fu re MVR (Cesar said he had), invoice for April 28, and medical card

Medicare

Per client, after surgery it was worse.
