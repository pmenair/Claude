Okay, before we start the video record, let's say for purposes of stipulation that we are taking this deposition of Andrew Wade, MD for preservation of evidence for trial, objections to be contemporaneous or waived, and lets go ahead and make them on the record. Is that agreeable?

Please start the video and swear the witness.

Dr. Wade, could you please start by introducing yourself to the jury.

Are you a medical doctor?

Where did you go to medical school?

When did you graduate?

Where did you do your residency?

Where have you been employed since your residency?

What type of practice do you have, currently?

Tell me more about the specialty of radiology, what does a radiologist do?

Tell me specifically what training you've had in the area of radiology.

Do you have any board certifications?

Are all doctors board certified?

Have you published in any medical journals?

In what states are you licenced to practice medicine?

How long have you practiced in Georgia?

Have there been any interruptions in your Georgia practice?

Are there any credentials you have that we haven't discussed?

In addition to your medical practice, do you also provide expert testimony at trials?

How long have you been doing that?

Are being paid for your time here today?

Did you meet with me and/or Mr. Leibel prior to today?

Were you paid for the time you spent talking to us?

How much of your expert work is on behalf of plaintiffs, versus defendants?

Has my firm ever hired you before?

What is your hourly rate? Your annual income from expert work?

How active are you currently with respect to actual practice of medicine, versus expert work.

How often have you been qualified as an expert in a legal proceeding?

Is it in your area of expertise to review a shoulder MRI, which is what you've been asked to do in this case?

How many shoulder MRIs have you looked at?

Can you tell me briefly what the difference is between an MRI and an XRay or a CT scan?

Please tell me what you reviewed to prepare yourself for your testimony today?

In particular, did you review the MR study of Althea Shea's left shoulder performed on March 24, 2017?

Did you review a written opinion regarding that study by Dr. Barry Jefferies?

Did you review Dr. Jefferies' deposition testimony?

Did you review any other medical records of Althea Shea?

Any other imaging?

Any other documents we haven't talked about?

Did you consult any medical literature or treatises in forming an opinion on this case?

Let's talk about your own review of that March 2017 MRI series first. Please tell the jury what it is you observed in that study.

Are you able to show it to us?

Is there anything you observed in that study that suggested to you that the shoulder tear may have been caused or exacerbated by trauma occuring on or around January 28, 2017?

Is there anything you observed in that study that would foreclose the possibility that the shoulder tear was caused or exacerbated by trauma occuring on or around January 28, 2017?

What significance, if any, is associated with the fact that the problem with this was a superspinatus tendon issue?

Does the fact that this was a superspinatus issue in any way foreclose the possibility of traumatic causation, as opposed to some sort of chronic process?

Do you ever see tendon tears in traumatic shoulder injuries?

Did you observe any fracture in this study?

What difference does that make, if any?

What about the presence or absence of joint fluid?

What about the presence or absence of edema?

Would you expect to see traumatic edema in a study taken two months after the traumatic incident?

Are you able to definitively state whether this shoulder presentation was caused or exacerbated by trauma, as opposed to a chronic process?

What about trauma in the form of a traffic accident that took place in January of 2017?

Would it make a difference to your opinion if that traffic accident did not result in significant property damage?

Are you able as a matter of biomechanics to state an opinion as to whether this is the type of shoulder injury that might have been caused or exacerbated by a rear end traffic collision?

Does it make a difference to your opinion that Ms. Shea was a house painter?

If another doctor stated that it was his opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that this injury was NOT caused or exacerbated by a car accident in January of 2017, would you defer to that opinion or disagree?

Have you reviewed the opinions and testimony of Dr. Jefferies?

What if anything do you specifically disagree with him about in this case?

Stepping back from the specific context of that March 2017 MRI study, what opinions do you have arising from the other records you've reviewed in the case?

Are you able to state an opinion regarding the reasonableness and necessity of the medical treatment Ms. Shea has received, based on those records?

What, in your view, is the prognosis of this case? Future treatment?

Do you have any other opinions regarding this case that we haven't discussed?

Have all of your opinions today been to a reasonable degree of medical certainty?

Are those opinions supported by anything we haven't talked about?
