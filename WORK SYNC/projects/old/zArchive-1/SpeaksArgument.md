# SPEAKS ORAL ARGUMENT

10a J. Laine


A summons was served, a summons and a citation are not the same thing.

Not just whether right court, and I'm not even saying this court doesn't have jxn to "deal with this situation." It's whether the relief they seek is proper under the statute. 

He's rewriting the complaint as we speak.

And he's not simply asking for relief under the statute, he's alleging tort claims, because he wants tort claims to support a 13-6-11 claim.

He's not picking a lane. He wants this to be a separate action.

Jury?

Good afternoon, your honor. We're here today on a motion by my client, Daniel Speaks, to dismiss a complaint for damages that was filed by his sister, Rebecca McMillian. We're also here on a motion regarding my noticed deposition, and Mr. Hatcher will speak to that.

The underlying dispute here involves competing petitions for administration of a decedent's estate. My client has filed to probate a will, whereas Ms. McMillian initially sought appointment of herself of purposes of intestate administration and now seeks appointment of a county adminstrator. 

The Complaint that we're here about today is captioned as a verified complaint under the style and number of the estate of Patricia Speaks, and it purports to invoke this Court's concurrent jurisdiction with the superior court.

Our motion to dismiss is based on a number of arguments, one of them withdrawn and one which I frankly would have waived if it were not, in my opinion, deeply intertwined with the other issues here. The argument that is withdrawn is our argument regarding *service* of process. I represented to this Court that I would acknowledge service once a form of process was decided on, and I did so. 

However, the acknowledgment I filed reserved the right to assert a defense as to the form of process, and I will briefly make a proffer of that argument. I don't intend to dwell on it, because the Court has already ruled. But I think the proper manner of proceeding in this Court is always by citation, as expressly provided in OCGA ยง 15-9-86.1, and under OCGA ยง 9-11-81 the Civil Practice Act applies only where there is no special statutory provision to the contrary. Again, I don't intend to dwell on this because I believe the Court has already come to its decision, and also because I don't want to exalt form over substance.

As a final preliminary matter, on the issue of venue, it came to my attention yesterday that my client does, in fact, live in Hall County. I apologize for the error in arguing to the contrary, which was only mine, although I will say in my own defense that the underlying complaint does not allege venue in the ordinary way of tort claims, as would be proper if this were the ordinary and independent suit for damages it purports to be.

On to the substance. As part of this Court's expanded Article 6 jurisdiction, the Court has the authority to hear certain matters relating to the conduct of fiduciaries who are properly before the Court, including claims under OCGA ยง 10-6B-16(a), which is a statute in the agency section of the Georgia Code giving persons other than a principal the authority to seek what's referred to in the statute as "appropriate relief."

However, nothing that I see in that statute expressly provides for a private right of action for damages to be paid to someone who simply seeks to stand in the principals shoes for purposes of asserting an ordinary tort claim as if they were the decedent or the decedent's representative, which is what is being attempted here. 

It's important to note that the claims actually stated in the complaint here are for breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, and money had and received, NOT claims under 10-6B-16(a) for an order to marshal or preserve estate assets; 10-6B-16 is simply mentioned as a purported basis for jurisdiction over independent tort claims asserted by one heir against another, which are being prosecuted before this Court has even established the Ms. McMillian will be entitled to inherit anything from her mother at all. 

At the simplest level of approaching this, all of those tort claims should plainly be dismissed on their face for failure to state a claim. Breach of fidiciary duty, for example, requires a duty running to the plaintiff. That's an element of the claim. Conversion and money had and recieved, similarly, require a present right to the funds, and, well, this was the decedent's money. So at a basic level, the complaint as currently pled fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted under well established Georgia.

This Court's expanded jurisdiction is, I would submit, not intended to make this a court for the general prosecution of tort claims for damages on behalf of decedents; still less is it intended to allow heirs to simply pursue such claims in their own right, without even going to the trouble of seeking appointment as an estate representative.

If the Court denies our motion to dismiss, I would request and hope that the Court would grant certification of its ruling for immediate review. However, would the supersedeas on that appeal, assuming it went forward, extend to the pending probate and administration petitions? I don't think it's clear. And I would submit that this lack of clarity arises from the fact that this action is improper, because it's neither fish nor fowl. And as a result, we're confronted with procedural problems with the potential to distract this Court from its ordinary role as the arbiter of appointment and removal of fiduciaries and the administration of decedent's estates.

Now, briefly, regarding my fees request. I mentioned in my brief certain matters respecting discovery, but I am not here today to ask for fees relating to the other side's general discovery conduct. My request is for fees under OCGA       9-15-14 on the motion to dismiss. If the Court is inclined to hear my evidentiary proffer on the fees issue, I'm prepared to do that now, but I imagine the other side might have cross-examination for me and I don't want to get us side-tracked by that. If the Court would prefer to reserve the evidentiary portion the fees issue for later, then I would be happy to answer any questions regarding argument and reserve any remaining time for rebuttalSo unless the Court would prefer to go forward with that portion now, I will reserve my time.

My time is billed to Mr. Speaks at a rate of $350 per hour, which I believe to be a reasonable and customary rate for the services of attorneys with my level of experience in metropolitan Atlanta. My practice is located in Cumming, Georgia. I have been practicing law since my federal clerkship ended in 2003 in the area of general litigation. Originally I specialized in estate and fiduciary litigation, but I have experience with a wide variety of matters, from complex commercial litigation to ordinary tort work.

I have not been billing my client for my time spent bringing his new counsel on board and communicating with people regarding my own deposition. Because I have been withholding my billing, I have not yet billed him for the time I spent preparing the answer to the petition and the motion to dismiss, but I see from my notes that it was 2.5 hours spent drafting the answer and motion to dismiss. I will be putting that time on my billing for the next cycle, along with 2.2 hours I spent a couple of weeks ago, 2.5 spent yesterday preparing for this hearing and whatever time we spend today. I believe that the amount of time I have spent on this motion was reasonable and necessary under the circumstances.
