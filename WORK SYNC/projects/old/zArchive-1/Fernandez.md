# OUTLINE

This is the deposition of Olivia Oyegunle, taken pursuant to notice and agreement of counsel under the Georgia Civil Practice Act for purpose of discovery and all other purposes allowable by law. My understanding is that we will be reserving objections, except to the form of the question and responsiveness of the answer, until the first lawful use of the deposition, is that agreeable? Would you like to put something on the record about signature?

Swear

Ms. Oyegunle, my name is Paul Menair, I'm an attorney with Steven Leibel PC and I represent Daniell Fernandez in the lawsuit against you.

Have you ever given sworn testimony before?

I am going to ask you a series of questions. You are under oath. Do you understand what it means to be under oath?

The court reporter will be trying to make a written transcript of what we say here today, and it helps her if we try not to talk over each other, okay?

Please let me know if I interrupt you before you're finished, or if you don't understand a question, otherwise I will assume that you understood the question and gave me a complete response. Is that fair?

Please also try and keep in mind that the usual noises and hand signals and head nods that people use to communicate with don't translate very will into print, alright?

I am happy to take a break at any time you like, but if there's a question on the table I will ask you to answer it before you leave the room, fair enough?

Can you state your full name for the record.

Have you ever gone by any other names?

What is your date of birth?

Would you tell me your social security number off the record? 254-81-9562

Do you have a current driver's license? Is it the same as what you produced a copy of in discovery?

Restrictions? Corrective lenses?

Is the address current?

For today's record, what address?

I'll represent for the record that the driver's license that you produced to us says you live at 3313 Spring Lake Hollow, Lithonia, DeKalb County, Georgia. Is that your correct address?

And for whatever it's worth, according to the accident report you were living there in 2018 as well, correct?

You were living with your father in 2018?

In the answer that your attorney filed and in your responses to our requests for admissions, which we served with the complaint, it said that you deny venue is proper in DeKalb County. Do you know why?

Is that because you moved to 1989 Cheshire Bridge Road, Apartment 1333, Atlanta 30324 in January of this year?

Apparently your father told my process server that you still lived at his address in August of this year, though, is that correct?

Did you move out permanently?

Is there some reason you didn't get your driver's license updated?

Is the Cheshire Bridge address in Fulton County?

You were served at that address twice by my records, once through your father by a private process server and once personally by the sheriff, does that sound right?

Have you taken any medication today, or drunk any alcohol, or done anything else that might affect your ability to give accurate and truthful testimony?

Without telling me what was said, did you talk with your lawyer to prepare for today's deposition? Did you review any documents?

What was your cell phone number on july 27, 2018? 404-519-3637
