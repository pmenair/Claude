Significant discovery questions hindering investigation into motor carrier
Significant gaps that can even include opinions relevant to driver's action

[ ] fucking need to update the topics
[ ] can't talk about what the company did until we know how the driver failed
[ ] can't say whether he was on the phone with his supervisor
[ ] distracted driving
[ ] time of calls - Carrier representative may have been on the phone with him

----depose the driver?

no logs or timecards
GPS ECM etc - ask 30b6 did they have the capability to track trucks etc
produce any telemetry they had
delay in drug test, no alcohol
time in service, short haul exemption probably doesn't apply
need to understand more about the route, find address
regs rewritten right after, changed 100 air mile to 150 air miles, 12 to 14 hours
trip back to Chattanooga is on duty
time records
application for ordinary role [see also THE OTHER CASE]
ACTUALLY HE WAS HIRED TO DRIVE A PICKUP Nov 2018 medical certificate, prior to CDL
should have filled out a commercial driver application, should have REAPPLIED in any event
commercial driver not CDL driver initially pre-employment test DOT only given to CDL drivers, doesn't necessarily mean he was operating without the proper license but does mean the carrier gave him the wrong test because he didn't have a CDL yet
specific parameters, more stringent, medical review officer
[ ] obtain TN certified driving record, any other states
[ ] no chain of custody document on drug test
some concerns about medical, e.g. don't know whether he was tested with corrective lenses, no long forms, maybe doctor shopping, no documentation that they verified the examiner (but examiner was on the registry)
no documented training pre-crash (he says ACPA but not documented), no entry level required prior to Feb 2022, no CMV driver finishing training, relevant training was conducted post-accident, his claim is odd because it doesn't make sense they wouldn't have documented.
post-accident remediation, no seatbelt remediation, not speeding remediation, after this crash only some training, other violations post crash, nothing happens to him, he gets promoted instead

tie driver directly to lack of training
1. alcohol test 8 hrs, presumptive positive, should have disqualified
2. cell phone [need guy he called - need to tie down timeline]
3. hours of service, Mike won't testify tired, but violation is a problem re industry standards
4. lane change is training and qualification issue, age and experience
insurance company

Mike could testify to issues in the case provided he has supplemental and 30b6

Person most knowledgeable re safety, risk management, training, of CPP relative to employment of this driver

[ ] list of topics

30b6

30b6 of insurance company to talk about insurability of this driver and any loss control audits etc

Caleb Nelson
Jason Pitts
Kevin Winger

NEED 60 DAYS, but can write a limited report and leave the investigation open when additional discovery available


loss control audits, represenations to carrier
manuals or guides
etc

Did insurance company find this guy unacceptable after accident

Dear Mr. Velcheck,

I am in receipt of your informal appeal of termination dated July 13, 2023.  I am responding within the 10-day business window afforded by FCSO policy.

The Office of Professional Standards investigation has sustained a violation of Truthfulness/Cooperation (General Order 207 1(VI).  I have reviewed your appeal letter and the context and content you provide.  While you recount your recollection of your interactions with investigators of the Office of Professional Standards, you not once respond to the sustained finding of your truthfulness violation or offer any explanation of your differing statements offered to the OPS investigators.  While your actions as a supervisor with the FCSO were not in keeping with the best interest, values and conduct of a FCSO supervisor, it is your act of untruthfulness that led to your dismissal.

As to your belief that you were not afforded due process, you were afforded at your termination hearing the opportunity to speak and be heard regarding the circumstances of your termination. 

You were fully aware that any act of untruthfulness in an official capacity such as an OPS investigation would lead to termination and other former employees with the same offense have been treated similarly.  This is widely known and often spoken of across the FCSO. 

Based upon the foregoing, I must sustain your termination.  You may have additional rights under the Forsyth County Civil Service system which were provided to you at your termination by members of the Forsyth County Personnel Services. 

 

Regards,

 

Ron Freeman

Sheriff, Forsyth County Georgia
