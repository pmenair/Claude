RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT LINDA JOHANSON'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

COMES NOW the above Plaintiff and files his Response to Defendant Linda Johanson's Motion for Summary Judgment, showing the following:

Facts

At the time of the collision at issue in this case, Defendant Johanson was involved with the food ministry at City on a Hill Church in Forsyth County. (Johanson Depo., copy attached as Exhibit A, at 11:7-15.) Defendant McCartney was the nephew of Royal Clevenger, who ran the food ministry at her church, and she knew him only in that context. (Johanson Depo at 11:16-18; 17:05-11.) Johanson let Mr. Clevenger regularly use the vehicle, which she had purchased from the church, on church business, providing him with a key so that he could make use of it whenever he wished. (17:12-15, 18:08-22, 21:09-11.) On one occasions, Mr. Clevenger allowed Defendant McCartney to use the vehicle, and the accident occurred that gave rise to the present litigation. (Johanson Depo. at 21:02-14.) Mr. McCartney had a history of reckless driving and moving violations. (McCartney Depo., copy attached as Exhibit B, at 15:06-17, 17:07-23, 18:03-16.) 

Argument and Citation of Authorities

Negligent entrustment is generally described as the act of lending a dangerous instrumentality to another with the knowledge that th eother is incompetent or habitually reckless. Zaldivar v. Prickett, 297 Ga. 589, 602 (2015). This statement of the rule has been recognized to be consistent with the broader rule articulated in Restatement (Second) of Torts ยง 390:

One who supplies directly or through a third person a chattel for the use of another whom the supplier knows or has reason to know to be likely because of his youth, inexperience, or otherwise, to use it in a manner involving unreasonable risk of physical harm to himself and others whom the supplier should expect to share in or be endangered by its use, is subject to liability for physical harm resulting to them.

Id at 603 (citing Pitts v. Ivester, 171 Ga.App. 312, 313 (1984)).

In other words, the application of liability in entrustment cases is broader that Defendant suggests on the present motion. It does not necessarily involve an automobile (Pitts, supra, involved a firearm). It admits that knowledge of the possibility of reckless use may be inferred from circumstantial evidence. See, e.g., May v. Phillips, 157 Ga. App. 630, 631 (1981). And the principle is not limited to cases involving permitted use; even where, as here, there is an intervening actor, the ultimate inquiry is whether the defendant should reasonably have foreseen the negligence that resulted in harm. See generally Johnson v. Avis Rent A Car Sys., 311 Ga. 588, 592-98 (2021) (rental car theft case).

Here, Johanson provided unrestricted use of the vehicle to Mr. Clevenger; she gave him his own key. It was absolutely forseeable that he might entrust the vehicle to another individual from the church community with a history of reckless driving. Johanson should not be entitled to hide behind the fact that she allowed an intervening actor to make decisions regarding the use of her vehicle.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully prays that the motion presently before the Court be denied.
