# Mediation

Cassie introduces Lee Trail (Tristar claims adjuster) and Setterstrom DOAS, Suber-Drake and Stan Mitchell DOE.

3MM demanded, but we understand caps.

First number is 25,000, just the CHOA bill. 

Sent 999,999 back, threaten offer of settlement, talks a lot about ways to get around the 1MM cap. Looking for a six digit number, preferably with an 8 in front of it.

Per Murphy they are not pushing back much on the underlying facts. They think Grant is more or less fine, and they are not aware of any *mandatory* standards.

--> 37,500 is their idea of 1x med. They are deeply sceptical of long term impact on Grant.

Murphey --> they think he's doing well and he's going to disprove the theory that he's not doing well. They just don't believe it. As the state puts their case together they might change their mind. I don't think the state can indemnify FFA. This case isn't ready for settlement because the state hasn't done anything. They percieve no threat through FFA.

SKL we'll see you in court. We don't think there's a cap on FFA and is there an indemnification?

Murphey --> They will go to 100 if we go to 200.

SKL --> We'll go to 700 if they go to 250.

Murphey --> Hard number; 120,000k; she described her bracket as an "honest bracket." Suggest 500 or less.

SKL --> 600k

Murphey --> 135k

SKL --> we'll go to 500 if you go to 250

Murphey --> 150k

SKL --> We have 62k in actuals that come off the table, ERISA and expenses. I'll go to 580 if they don't want to do my bracket. To get Grant 100k, we need to go to 300k.

SKL --> 520 hard, 450 to 250 bracket

Murphey --> 175k is the "outer limit"

SKL --> we want 250k and 4 years at a state supported college and cost of mediation

Bed rails are the "standard" now for bunk beds that are sold and manufactured, definitely before that. As a safety expert I would say replace as opposed to retro-fit. Gaps between meet requirement.

Not a standard expert or a warning label expert, set Consumer Produce Safety Commission document from dataset, NEISS. Hospital emergency room data. National Electronic Injury Surveillance System.

July 2000 requirement, ASTM bunkbed standards folks, committees, how applied in a camp setting. Look at CPSC website. Dawn Comstock does camp stuff, she might be a source. dawn.comstock@ucdenver.edu has a camp dataset.

Sovereign immunity and entities

I think the analogy here is to hospital authorities: They are not entitled to sovereign immunity (Thomas v. Hosp. Auth, 264 Ga. 40 (Ga. 1994)), but the state's sovereign immunity is not waived as a consequence of its doing business through this "instrumentality." But see "proprietary function" exception discussed in Thomas at length in dicta. Argument essentially is that they have tacitly admitted that running the camp is a proprietary function by allowing a private entity to operate it. But see hospital authorities. Generally also propriety function exceptions apply only to municipalities.

DOT v. Miller re discretionary function exception

Bontwell v. Department of Corrections 226 Ga. App. 524 (Ga. Ct. App. 1997) is another bad case for us; arguing proprietary function pushed it into discretionary because it invoked "economic factor"

Cases saying proprietary only applies to municipal tend to be disting bc the other option is a county. But still. I think Rutherford is really bad for us.

Sovereign Immunity:

Stephens County School District dismissed

Sovereign immunity is complicated. Kyle v. Ga. Lottery Corp., 290 Ga.
87, 718 S.E.2d 801, 2011 Ga. LEXIS 934, 2011. Attorney in Covington told
me there was little involvement by his entities but someone did sit on
the board of the camp, organization is confusing. Sovereign immunity if
FFA is an "instrumentality" of the state but cannot be delegated. See
Restatement 2d of Agency § 271 comment b ("[i]mmunities, unlike
privileges, are not delegable and are available as a defense only to
persons who have them."), adopted by the Georgia Supreme Court in
Gilbert v. Richardson, 264 Ga. 744, 754 (1994). I think it's important
that it wasn't created by the state, like a ports authority or what have
you.


I am writing re follow up to the depositions we have conducted and
documents discussed in those depositions, and also to let you know that
we would like to schedule the depositions of Stan Mitchell and Patricia
Hall. Please provide dates. Please also provide:

1. A list of staff at the Camp for the past five years, with their dates
   of service;
2. Documents relating to any DOAS inspections or site visits, including
   correspondence and email, inspection reports, etc.;
3. The agreement with the North Region;
4. The farm insurance policy;
5. Any listserv or other email discussion re bunk bed safety or bed
   rails;
6. Copies of the improvement reports referencing bed rail purchases;
7. Any documents Stan Mitchell may have that were provided to campers
   other than what was produced;
8. The summer leadership program "one pager";
9. Any installation instructions, invoices, quotes, or other materials
   relating to the bed rails that were installed.

Also, if Mr. Towns could let me know which account the bed rails were
paid for out of, I would appreciate it. Thank you for your attention to
this.

Paul
