PLAINTIFF'S BRIEF IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

The above plaintiff ("Plaintiff" or "Peterson") responds to the motion for summary judgment of the above defendants (collectively, "Defendants" or "Walmart") as follows:

I. Statement of Facts

Peterson is married to Bernd Peterson. (Deposition of Ginger Peterson ["Peterson Depo."] [DOC 44] at 14:1-3.) She visited a Walmart store in Georgia with her husband on December 29 of 2018. (Peterson Depo. at 85:20-86:3, 89:11-15.) On her way out of the store, she slipped on something "wet and slick." (Peterson Depo. at 101:19-102:06, 111:19-112:05.)

Immediately after her fall, Peterson was in severe pain. (Peterson Depo. at 77:2-18.) She was very confused and was taken away in an ambulance. (Peterson Depo. at 82:1-14, 83:2-4.) She has poor recollection of what was said or who she spoke with after her fall. (Peterson Depo. at 93:10-95:04.) She did not overhear any conversations her husband had with Walmart staff. (Peterson Depo. at 95:5-8.) She does not recall whether her husband, who was walking slightly ahead of her and to one side, examined the floor after she fell. (Peterson Depo. at 105:14-25, 112:17-20.) At her deposition, she was unable to identify photographs taken by Walmart, allegedly of the area where she fell. (Peterson Depo. at 116:23-119:19.)

Peterson's husband noticed a wet and sticky substance on the floor after his wife fell. (Declaration of Bernd Peterson ["Peterson Declaration"], attached as Exhibit A, at ¶6.) He did not see the substance initially because the floors were highly polished. (Peterson Declaration at ¶7.) He notified a Walmart employee regarding the substance. (Peterson Declaration at ¶8.)

Sonya Brumbelow, the Customer Service Manager on the front end of the store, was responsible for the safety of customers in the front of the store, among other responsibilities. (Deposition of Sonya Brumbelow ["Brumbelow Depo."] [DOC 45] at 6:22-25, 7:10-19.) She was informed of the fall and went to the area where Peterson fell after the fall occurred. (Brumbelow Depo. at 9:24-10:22.) She was the person who called 911. (Id.) She did not take any photographs. (Brumbelow Depo. at 12:07-12.) She claims that no one told her anything about how Peterson fell. (Brumbelow Depo. at 12:15-20.) Brumbelow confirms that Peterson was visibly in pain. (Brumbelow Depo. at 15:05-08.) She walked away as soon as the EMTs arrived. (Brumbelow Depo. at 15:14-25.) The person who notified Brumbelow was Rebecca Hix, a person employed as a people greeter at the store. (Brumbelow Depo. at 10:23-11:04; Hanes Depo. at 18:5-24; Defendants' Responses to Plaintiff's Interrogatories, attached as Exhibit B, at pp. 2-3.)

Brumbelow testified that she visually inspected the area where she found Peterson for slip hazards and found nothing. (Brumbelow Depo. at 17:09-22.) However, she concedes that she was focused on making sure that Peterson obtained treatment. (Brumbelow Depo. at 17:23-25.) She further concedes that she did not ask anyone how the fall happened; her visual inspection of the area, while dealing with an injured customer, was her only basis for concluding that there was no visible hazard. (Brumbelow Depo. at 23:25-24:12.) She estimates that the time she spent visually inspecting the area was approximately thirty minutes. (Brumbelow Depo. at 24:22-25.) However, the actual period of time she spent visually examining the area, while interacting with Peterson, was likely significantly shorter in duration. (See Peterson Depo. at 121:24-124:11 (showing time of fall at 14:13; EMS Run Report, attached as Exhibit C, showing time on scene 14:24.)

According to Brumbelow, Walmart's policy requires all employees to be on the look out for hazards and carry a towel in their pocket to wipe up spills. (Brumbelow Depo. at 18:01-19:01.) Natalie Hanes, Walmart's corporate representative, testified that a Walmart employee was stationed to greet customers near where Peterson fell; this likely would have been Rebecca Hix, the person who first notified Brumbelow regarding the fall. (Deposition of Natalie Hanes ["Hanes Depo."], filed contemporaneously herewith, at 18:16-24.) Hanes was also unsure who took the photographs. (Hanes Depo. at 25:21-26:11.) According to Hanes, cleaning is conducted in the store overnight and during the day with no set schedule, and there is no way to know whether any formal safety sweeps were conducted in the store on the day of the fall. (Hanes Depo. 29:19-30:15; 38:23-39:02.) It is simply a store policy for all employees to be on the lookout for hazards and "clean as you go." (Brumbelow Depo. at 38:23-39:02, 51:01-53:02.) Records of inspection activities are not maintained. (Defendants' Response to Plaintiff's Interrogatories at 13-14, 17-18.)

II. Argument and Citation of Authorities

A. Standard of Decision

The Court grants summary judgment if, but only if, the movant is able to show that there is "no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a). 

To withstand a motion for summary judgment, the Georgia Supreme Court has held that a slip-and-fall plaintiff is not required to produce evidence to disprove the plaintiff's own negligence. Robinson v. Kroger, 268 Ga. 735, 747-48 (1997). Accordingly, care must be taken regarding Georgia caselaw predating 1997, as these cases often involve an assessment of a plaintiff's fault and may have been indirectly or impliedly overruled by Robinson.

The Robinson case left as the sole remaining issue on summary judgment the requirement that the plaintiff raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding the defendant's actual or constructive knowledge of the specific hazard at issue in the case. Hardee's Food Systems v. Green, 232 Ga. App. 864, 865 (1998). It is often difficult or impossible to show actual knowledge of a slip-and-fall hazard, and these cases generally turn on the issue of constructive knowledge. The rule regarding constructive knowledge of a premises hazard under Georgia law is as follows:

"Constructive knowledge may be demonstrated in two ways: (1) by showing that a store employee was present in the immediate area and could easily have seen the substance and removed it, or (2) by showing that the substance had been on the floor for such a time that it would have been discovered and removed had the proprietor exercised reasonable care in inspecting the premises."

Wallace v. Wal-Mart Stores, 272 Ga. App. 343, 345 (2005) (citing Roberson v. Winn-Dixie Atlanta, 247 Ga. App. 825, 825-826 (2001).

As discussed in more detail below, Plaintiff is able to point to record evidence establishing a genuine issue of material fact on both prongs of the constructive knowledge test.

B. The Hazard Was Sufficiently Visible to a Nearby Employee

Defendants cite a number of cases for the asserted proposition that they cannot be held liable because the hazard purportedly was, as they repeatedly state, "invisible." See Hardee's Food Systems v. Green, 232 Ga. App. 864 (1998) (discussed above); Rodriquez v. City of Augusta, 222 Ga. App. 383 (1996); Lovins v. Kroger Company, 236 Ga. App. 585 (1999); Kitchens v. Restaurant Management Services, Inc., 192 Ga. App. 313 (1989). All of these cases either predate or were decided shortly after the Robinson case. Two of these cases have an entirely doubtful relationship to the issue of visibility of the hazard and turn, instead, on the proximity of employees. See Lovins (spinach dip on floor of a supermarket) and Kitchens (french fry on floor of a restaurant). The other two cases involve recently mopped floors, and in one of those cases, Green, the plaintiff actually watched the floor being mopped immediately prior to the fall. The other case, Rodriquez, is the only case involving a truly "invisible" hazard; however, it is worth noting that there was testimony to the effect that the floor in Rodriguez had been inspected only a short time prior to the fall, the importance of which is discussed below in the context of the reasonable inspection prong of the test. 

A better discussion of the visibility issue can be found in Allen v. Walmart, Inc., Civil Action No. 2:18-cv-164-RWS (N.D. Ga. Jan. 16, 2020) (available at 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7346, copy attached as Exhibit D.) In that case, this Court, through Judge Richard w. Story, recently held as follows:

"As the Georgia Court of Appeals recently illustrated, the ['invisibility'] principle does not reach terribly far, in part because a plaintiff's admissions concerning the visibility of the hazard are still construed in her favor....The margins between [the leading case establishing the invisibility principle] and those cases that distinguish it are often slim."

Allen at 9-10.

The Allen Court identified the leading Georgia case in this area as Chastain v. CF Ga. North DeKalb, 256 Ga. App. 802 (2002), a case that turned on the visibility of "dribbles" of water on a floor. In Allen, a case involving a "small puddle" of water that was not visible in the pictures taken by the defendant in that case (also Walmart), Judge Story distinguished Chastain while awarding summary judgment on different grounds, discussed below.

Here, the hazard was visible to Plaintiff's husband on visual inspection after the fact. There was an employee, the greeter, in the vicinity who could have seen the hazard. The fact that the hazard is not visible in subsequent photographs and was allegedly not visible to a distracted employee who assisted Plaintiff for a brief period of time is not dispositive and does not require this Court to enter judgment as a matter of law on visibility grounds.[fn][Regarding Keisha v. Dundon, 344 Ga. App. 278 (2018), Plaintiff agrees with Judge Story that citation to this case as relevant to the issue of visibility of a hazard like the one at issue here "is not particularly persuasive." See Allen, n.1.]

C. This Walmart Did Not Conduct Reasonable Inspections

Regardless of the visibility of a hazard, Plaintiff can still survive summary judgment "by showing that the substance had been on the floor for such a time that it would have been discovered and removed had the proprietor exercised reasonable care in inspecting the premises." Wallace v. Wal-Mart Stores, 272 Ga. App. 343, 345 (2005) (citing Roberson v. Winn-Dixie Atlanta, 247 Ga. App. 825, 825-826 (2001). Note that on summary judgment the plaintiff has no burden to actually establish how long the hazard was in place unless and until the defendant has first established that it conducted reasonable inspections, generally by testimony of a party who actually inspected the area where the hazard existed some reasonable period of time prior and did not identify a hazard. "[A] plaintiff, in order to withstand a motion for summary judgment, need not show how long a substance has been on the floor unless the defendant has established that reasonable inspection procedures were in place and followed at the time of the incident." Hardees at 867-68 (quoting Straughter v. J. H. Harvey Co., 232 Ga. App. 29 (1998)).

In the Allen case, for example, Walmart was able to establish that it had a policy of requiring employees periodically to visually inspect the aisle in question for safety hazards and that such an inspection was *actually conducted* less than thirty minutes prior to the fall, although Judge Story noted that the policy evidence in that case was "thin." Allen at 11 and n.2. See, also, Hopkins v. K-Mart Corp., 232 Ga. App. 515, 516 (1998) (physical precedent only on this issue) (inspection within 30 minutes of fall). [fn]Edwards v. Wal-Mart Stores, 215 Ga. App. 336, 449 S.E.2d 613 (1994), another case cited by Defendants, predates Robinson and is actually determined by a finding of plaintiff negligence, so it is overruled by the Robinson case; in any event, that Court there did find evidence of constructive knowledge of a hazard involving hangers on the floor.]

The case at hand is distinguishable from Allen in that no evidence of an actual visual inspection of the area in question has been presented, nor is there any evidence that any safety-focused inspections in the form of "safety sweeps" were conducted on the day of the fall. Instead, the record suggests simply that Walmart relies on a policy requiring its employees to be on the lookout for hazards as a general matter. This case is factually more analogous to Golding v. Wal-Mart Stores E., LP, 7:19-cv-67 (WLS) (M.D. Ga. Dec. 7, 2021) (available at 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 236282, copy attached as Exhibit E), in which the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia held, in the context of deciding a motion for judgment as a matter of law following a jury verdict adverse to Walmart, that a similar policy was not "reasonable" as a matter of law. Golding at 6-7, citing numerous cases.

Here, although employees were stationed nearby and likely passed through this area any number of times that day, there is simply no record that anyone inspected this area for hazards while focused on that task and not distracted by other matters at any time whatsoever on the day of the fall. The two district court cases cited by Defendants as persuasive authority regarding the alleged reasonableness of this procedure are distinguishable and show what such evidence might look like; in both cases, there was affirmative testimony by Walmart employees that they had conducted a focused visual inspection of the area a short time before the fall. See Glenn v. Wal-Mart Stores East, LP, Case No. 1:18-cv-01119-CAP (N.D. Ga. Nov. 12, 2019), at *11 (available at 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 224310) (inspection conducted eleven minutes prior to the fall); Parker v. Wal-Mart Stores East, LP, Civil Action No. 1:16-CV- 1479-ODE (N.D. Ga. Aug. 23, 2018), at *19 (available at 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 233006, affirmed by Parker v. Wal-Mart Stores East, LP, 769 Fed. Appx. 875 (11th Cir. Apr. 25, 2019)) (inspection "minutes before" fall).[fn][The Gwinnett County State Court decision referenced by Defendants does not appear to be available online and was not attached to Defendants' brief.] See also Mucyo v. Publix Super Mkts., Inc., 301 Ga. App. 599, 601 (2009) (inspection two minutes prior to fall).

No such evidence exists in this case. Accordingly, Plaintiff submits that genuine issues exist for trial regarding whether Walmart was on constructive notice of the hazard at issue here.
