Subject Peace v. Pate 18A70868

Dear Ms. Videki,

We note that the Court has not yet signed the pretrial order in this case. Pursuant to the standing order entered in this case when it was before Judge Hydrick, we did not reserve the right to add additional parties to the witness list. However, we will need to add the following to the list of potential witnesses:

Kashana Yeates
Michael Peace Jr.
Mickel Peace
Melody Martin
Mark Terrell
Otis Cook
Regina Dobson
Robert Huff
Janyata R. Frazier Worthy

These are friends and family damages witnesses who can testify regarding the impact of the accident on the Plaintiff's life.

Please let me know if we may amend the proposed pretrial order to add these witnesses. I am copying opposing counsel on this email, and I would be happy to consent to a continuance if they feel it is necessary.
