3/26 22:38 [at least 20 min out] 

This is the deposition of Northeast Georgia, Inc., taken pursuant to notice and agreement of counsel under the Georgia Civil Practice Act for all allowable purposes including discovery and, as this is a discovery deposition, we will unless counsel tells me otherwise be reserving objection except to form, responsiveness, and privilege, is that agreeable?

[ ] [invoice dated 8/2, that was the date he was there]

The deposition is being conducted via videoconference with the witness outside of the physical presence of the officer administering the oath, but we are all in agreement that he is providing sworn testimony, yes?

Anything we want to say about signature?

Please go ahead and swear in the witness.

Good morning.

Please state your full name for the record.

Is there anyone in the room with you?

My name is Paul Menair and I represent the plaintiff in a lawsuit arising from a slip and fall at the McDonalds in Dahlonega, Georgia. I am going to ask you some questions, and you are here to answer them under oath. Do you have any questions about what that means, to be under oath, correct?

I have noticed this deposition as what lawyers call a rule 30b6 deposition, which means you have been designated to testify on behalf of a corporation, because obviously a corporation cannot speak for itself. I'm going to show you a list of topics relating to that designation and ask you a couple of questions about it. But first, do you generally understand the distinction I'm making, between testifying on behalf of a corporation and speaking on your own behalf?

I will have some questions about you personally as well, and hopefully it will be clear which hat I want you to wear in responding to a question, but if it ever isn't clear, please let me know, okay?

I'm showing you a list of topics from the notice of this deposition.

Are you the best person for me to talk to about these topics?

Are you prepared to talk about these things?

I know you met with your lawyer, and I don't want to know anything about what was said in that meeting, but I do want to know if you reviewed any documents, in that meeting or outside of it, to prepare for today?

What documents?

Okay, a couple more things before we get into it. First, if you ever need to take a break, that's fine, I just will ask for an answer to any questions that are already on the table before we go on break, sound fair?

I'm also happy to clarify any question I've asked, to the extent that I'm able, so please let me know if you don't understand something.

So let's start with some personal questions. What is your relationship with Northeast Georgia, Inc.?

[explore]

Where are you from, originally?

[education, work history]

Tell me a little about Northeast Georgia, Inc.

I'll represent the Georgia Secretary of State tells me the entity was formed in 1973 by Bob Swozoski and Frank Markette. What happened to Frank Markette?

Who are the shareholders now?

Is there a board of directors?

How many employees are there in the main office?

Report to you / you report to?

Where is the main office of Northeast Georgia, Inc. located?

How many McDonalds franchises?

Does the entity do anything other than run McDonalds franchises?

How many franchises?

Alright, let's get into the documents.

Answer

Familiar?

Affirmative defenses - basis

RFAs

Review this?

Northeast Georgia, Inc. admits that it operates a McDonalds at the premises where my client fell, correct?

And it was open for business on the day of the fall, yes?

And Northeast Georgia, Inc. has no reason to believe my client was there for any other reason than to transact business or, in other words, to purchase food or drink.

And the fall, if it happened in the vestibule, happened at a location that was entirely owned and controlled by Northeast Georgia, Inc.

And Northeast Georgia, Inc. was responsible for keeping the premises and its approaches safe for customers like my client.

And that responsibility includes keeping an eye out for slip hazards and remediating them.

This is one of the things McDonalds corporate requires of its franchisees, that they commit to keeping safe premises and follow certain policies and procedures about safety.

Including with respect to slip and fall hazards.

If you look at 7, it says that the company had made reasonable inquiry and couldn't say one way or another whether there was water on the floor where my client fell, was that accurate?

Sitting here today, is that still the case?

In here you, and I mean the corporation, deny jurisdiction and venue, and I'm going to ask your lawyer if there are any issues I need to talk to the witness about, is this just vanishing venue if we lose the McDonalds entities?

For the witness, the corporation was properly and personally served through Brian Kinney at the office in Hall County, Georgia, yes?

There is some stuff about the John Does in these RFAs that we'll talk about later, lets move on though.

Seen these?

I have a separately produced verification, is that your signature?

And this verifies that the answers contained in the initial response were believed by you to be true at the time.

Let's look at the response to Interrogatory 1

Krystle was the general manager at the franchise, and I've talked to her, yes?

And today I'm talking to Northeast Georgia, Inc., right?

Who else at the company knows anything at all about this case?

Who have you personally discussed this case with, other than your lawyer?

Who has been involved in meetings with your lawyer, again without telling me what was said.

Since our complaint was filed, it's become clear that Northeast Georgia, Inc. employees a third party company to pressure wash its parking lot.

I deposed Scott Riley on that issue, you were aware of that, yes?

And I asked informally if you could look into whether there are invoices or any other documents that would help us figure out what dates pressure washing was conducted around the time of my client's fall. Yes?

Any news on that front since I spoke with?

4. "No one informed Defendant of the incident."

   I know it's hard to prove a negative, but what is your basis for this contention?

   Do you have any evidence that my client did not report this to your employees, other than the absence of documentation and Ms. Ives' testimony?

   Have you interviewed the employees that were on duty that day?

[ ] list of employees: time punch record August 4 or 5, just Aug 4 4/28/22

I was recently provided with some video that Ms. Ives preserved

She was responsible for that, yes?

[ ] Patrick Farmer, 8/5

Is the company aware of her testimony that she viewed two entire days of video but only preserved one hour?

Is that in accordance with company policy?

Tell me about how video is recorded and stored at the franchise in Dahlonega.

Off cite?

Vendor?

Any way to go back and get additional video, from those two days or any other days for example in that week?

11. No inspection, "as the term is understood." How does Northeast Georgia, Inc. understand that term?

    What is the company policy regarding periodic inspection of restaurant premises for slip and fall hazards?

    Is that Northeast Georgia, Inc.'s policy, McDonalds' policy, or both?

16. It says you don't claim anyone else was responsible for the fall, yes?

    Is that still the case?

    Are you aware of anything the pressure washing contractor may have done wrong that could have contributed to a fall?

    Have you communicated with them about this litigation?

    Have you done anything different, or instructed your pressure washing contractors to do anything different, since my client's fall?

    Do you still use the them?

19. No slip and falls over the past 10 years?

    How about other restaurants?

20. This says you do daily inspections.

    When is the daily checklist performed?

    How recorded?

    Who?

Alright, let's talk about documents produced. You produced an insurance policy, I'm not going to put it in the record, but it looks like coverage is 1MM.

And you are not aware of any denials of coverage, reservations of right, anything like that.

Does your insurance company have any policies it asks you to follow regarding fall prevention?

So your fall prevention policies are just from McDonalds, as adopted by you?

---- Confidential

Okay, I am going to authenticate and discuss some material that has been marked confidential by the responding party, so I will propose that we handle this by creating a separate confidential volume to the transcript, any objection?

First document is title Franchise Agreement

Fair to say this governs the entity's relationship with McDonald's USA, LLC?

True correct copy

Was that true on the day of my client's fall?

McD USA is the operating company for the McD group?

We'll mark this Plaintiff's A, to keep the confidential designations separate, okay?

Page 1, at 1(a), describes the McD system. What is that?

Providing a safe environment for patrons is part of that system, fair?

Page 2, at 1(c), could you read that?

Fair to say franchisees are required to maintain certain standards as part of the system, in fact it says that's foundational, correct?

Those standards relate to Quality, Service, and Cleanliness.

And it talks about a close working relationship between McD and the franchisee.

Page 3, at Para. 3, McDonalds consults with and advises the franchisee regularly, yes?

In fact, Ms. Ivie told me they made regular visits to the franchise location to inspect, yes?

How often?

Para. 4 talks about manuals containing operating procedures.

Does this agreement require the franchisee company to adopt the procedures in those manuals?

Para. 6, next page, McD provides training.

Tell me how that works.

p. 6-7 you have to comply with the entire system, yes?

And they perform inspections to be sure that's happening?

Those include cleaning and safety protocols, yes?

Ex. B what's this?

McD USA LLC is the landlord, correct?

Ex C what's this?

NE Ga Inc. is the franchisee, not RS personally

Why that change?

Let's look at Ex D

What is this

Is this used at the McDonalds in Dahlonega

Does it constitute a policy document of NE Ga Inc.

Read the portion that begins "Franchisees are exclusively responsible"

What do you understand that to mean?

How is that consistent with the franchise agreement?

Did NE Ga Inc. establish any of its own policies relating to planned and daily maintenance, or is this it?

The contents of this document are the policy of NE Ga Inc., correct?

Let's look at Ex E

This is a McD, document, is it also a policy document adopted by NE Ga. Inc.?

You are aware there is a similar disclaimer relating to francisee adoption of this document, yes?

Did NE Ga Inc adopt any of its own guidelines or policies relating to Safety and Security, other than what's in here?

It's important to provide a safe environment for patrons, correct?

And part of that is preventing slip and fall injuries, yes?

What are the policies adopted by NE Ga, Inc. for the prevention of slip and fall injuries?

Is NE Ga Inc aware of any policies that might not have been or were not followed that could have contributed to my client's injury?

You are aware that my client testified he slipped and fell on a wet tile floor on the premises, where there were no wet floor signs, and that he reported that to store employees.

Do you think he's being untruthful?

If that was what actually happened, there would have been policy violations, correct?

What specifically?

I am going to provide the court reporter with copies of the exhibits I've used today via email, is there an objection to that? Is there anything special I should do, or she should do, relating to the confidential documents?
