Members of the Jury:

Now that you’ve been sworn, I need to explain some basic principles about a civil trial and your duty as jurors. These are preliminary instructions. I’ll give you more detailed instructions at the end of the trial.

The jury’s duty:

It’s your duty to listen to the evidence, decide what happened, and apply the law to the facts. It’s my job to provide you with the law you must apply – and you must follow the law even if you disagree with it.

What is evidence:

You must decide the case on only the evidence presented in the courtroom. Evidence comes in many forms. It can be testimony about what someone saw, heard, or smelled. It can be an exhibit or a photograph. It can be someone’s opinion.

Some evidence may prove a fact indirectly. Let’s say a witness saw wet grass outside and people walking into the courthouse carrying wet umbrellas. This may be indirect evidence that it rained, even though the witness didn’t personally see it rain. Indirect evidence like this is also called “circumstantial evidence” – simply a chain of circumstances that likely proves a fact.

As far as the law is concerned, it makes no difference whether evidence is direct or indirect. You may choose to believe or disbelieve either kind. Your job is to give each piece of evidence whatever weight you think it deserves.

What is not evidence:

During the trial, you’ll hear certain things that are not evidence and you must not consider them.

First, the lawyers’ statements and arguments aren’t evidence. In their opening statements and closing arguments, the lawyers will discuss the case. Their remarks may help you follow each side’s arguments and presentation of evidence. But the remarks themselves aren’t evidence and shouldn’t play a role in your deliberations.

Second, the lawyers’ questions and objections aren’t evidence. Only the witnesses’ answers are evidence. Don’t decide that something is true just because a lawyer’s question suggests that it is. For example, a lawyer may ask a witness, “You saw Mr. Jones hit his sister, didn’t you?” That question is not evidence of what the witness saw or what Mr. Jones did – unless the witness agrees with it.

There are rules of evidence that control what the court can receive into evidence. When a lawyer asks a witness a question or presents an exhibit, the opposing lawyer may object if [he/she] thinks the rules of evidence don’t permit it.

If I overrule the objection, then the witness may answer the question or the court may receive the exhibit. If I sustain the objection, then the witness cannot answer the question, and the court cannot receive the exhibit. When I sustain an objection to a question, you must ignore the question and not guess what the answer might have been.

Sometimes I may disallow evidence – this is also called “striking” evidence – and order you to disregard or ignore it. That means that you must not consider that evidence when you are deciding the case.

I may allow some evidence for only a limited purpose. When I instruct you that I have admitted an item of evidence for a limited purpose, you must consider it for only that purpose and no other.

Credibility of witnesses:

To reach a verdict, you may have to decide which testimony to believe and which testimony not to believe. You may believe everything a witness says, part of it, or none of it. When considering a witness’s testimony, you may take into account:

· the witness’s opportunity and ability to see, hear, or know the things
the witness is testifying about;

· the witness’s memory;

· the witness’s manner while testifying;

· any interest the witness has in the outcome of the case;

· any bias or prejudice the witness may have;

· any other evidence that contradicts the witness’s testimony; the reasonableness of the witness’s testimony in light of all the evidence; and

· any other factors affecting believability.

At the end of the trial, I’ll give you additional guidelines for determining a witness’s credibility.

Description of the case:

This is a civil case. To help you follow the evidence, I’ll summarize the
parties’ positions. The Plaintiff, Ginger Peterson, claims the Defendant, Walmart, was negligent in allowing a slip hazard to exist in its store. Walmart denies those claims.

Burden of proof:

Ginger Peterson has the burden of proving her case by what the law calls a “preponderance of the evidence.” That means Ginger Peterson must prove that, in light of all the evidence, what she claims is more likely true than not. So, if you could put the evidence favoring Ginger Peterson and the evidence favoring Walmart on opposite sides of balancing scales, Ginger Peterson needs to make the scales tip to her side. If Ginger Peterson fails to meet this burden, you must find in favor of Walmart.

To decide whether any fact has been proved by a preponderance of the evidence, you may – unless I instruct you otherwise – consider the testimony of all witnesses, regardless of who called them, and all exhibits that the court allowed, regardless of who produced them. After considering all the evidence, if you decide a claim or fact is more likely true than not, then the claim or fact has been proved by a preponderance of the evidence.

While serving on the jury, you may not talk with anyone about anything related to the case. You may tell people that you’re a juror and give them information about when you must be in court. But you must not discuss anything about the case itself with anyone.

You shouldn’t even talk about the case with each other until you begin your deliberations. You want to make sure you’ve heard everything – all the evidence, the lawyers’ closing arguments, and my instructions on the law – before you begin deliberating. You should keep an open mind until the end of the trial. Premature discussions may lead to a premature decision.

In this age of technology, I want to emphasize that in addition to not talking face-to-face with anyone about the case, you must not communicate with anyone about the case by any other means. This includes e-mails, text messages, phone calls, and the Internet, including social-networking websites and apps such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube, and Twitter. You may not use any similar technology of social media, even if I have not specifically mentioned it here.

You must not provide any information about the case to anyone by any means whatsoever, and that includes posting information about the case, or what you are doing in the case, on any device or Internet site, including blogs, chat rooms, social websites, or any other means.

You also shouldn’t Google or search online or offline for any information about the case, the parties, or the law. Don’t read or listen to the news about this case, visit any places related to this case, or research any fact, issue, or law related to this case. The law forbids the jurors to talk with anyone else about the case and forbids anyone else to talk to the jurors about it. It’s very important that you understand why these rules exist and why they’re so important. You must base your decision only on the testimony and other evidence presented in the courtroom. It is not fair to the parties if you base your decision in any way on information you acquire outside the courtroom. For example, the law often uses words and phrases in special ways, so it’s important that any definitions you hear come only from me and not from any other source. Only you jurors can decide a verdict in this case.The law sees only you as fair, and only you have promised to be fair – no one else is so qualified.

Taking notes:

If you wish, you may take notes to help you remember what the witnesses said. If you do take notes, please don’t share them with anyone until you go to the jury room to decide the case. Don’t let note-taking distract you from carefully listening to and observing the witnesses. When you leave the courtroom, you should leave your notes hidden from view in the jury room. Whether or not you take notes, you should rely on your own memory of the testimony. Your notes are there only to help your memory. They’re not entitled to Ugreater weight than your memory or impression about the testimony.

Course of the trial:

Let’s walk through the trial. First, each side may make an opening statement, but they don’t have to. Remember, an opening statement isn’t evidence, and it’s not supposed to be argumentative; it’s just an outline of what that party intends to prove.

Next, Ginger Peterson will present his witnesses and ask them questions. After Ginger Peterson questions the witness, Walmart may ask the witness questions – this is called “cross-examining” the witness. Then Walmart will present its witnesses, and Ginger Peterson may cross-examine them. You should base your decision on all the evidence, regardless of which party presented it.

After all the evidence is in, the parties’ lawyers will present their closing arguments to summarize and interpret the evidence for you, and then I’ll give you instructions on the law.

You’ll then go to the jury room to deliberate.

During this trial, you may submit questions to a witness after the lawyers have finished their own questioning. Here is how the procedure works: After each witness has testified, and the lawyers have asked all of their questions, I’ll ask if any of you have questions. If you have a question, write it down and give it to the court staff. You may submit a question for a witness only to clarify an answer or to help you understand the evidence. Our experience with juror questions indicates that jurors rarely have more than a few questions for any one witness, and there may be no questions at all for some witnesses. If you submit a question, the court staff will give it to me and I’ll share your questions with the lawyers in the case. If the rules of evidence allow your question, one of the lawyers or I will read your question to the witness. I may modify the form or phrasing of a question so that it’s allowed under the evidence rules. Sometimes, I may not allow the questions to be read to the witness, either because the law does not allow it or because another witness is in a better position to answer the question. If I can’t allow the witness to answer a question, you must not draw any conclusions from that fact or speculate on what the answer might have been.

Here are several important things to keep in mind about your questions for the witnesses:

· First, you must submit all questions in writing. Please don’t ask any questions aloud.

· Second, the court can’t re-call witnesses to the stand for additional juror questions. If you have a question for a particular witness, you must submit it when I ask.

· Finally, because you should remain neutral and open-minded throughout the trial, you should phrase your questions in a way that doesn’t express an opinion about the case or a witness. You must keep an open mind until you’ve heard all the evidence, the closing arguments, and my final instructions on the law.

A deposition is a witness’s sworn testimony that is taken before the trial. During a deposition, the witness is under oath and swears to tell the truth, and the lawyers for each party may ask questions. A court reporter is present and records the questions and answers. The deposition of [name of witness], taken on [date], [is about to be/has been] presented to you [by a video/by reading the transcript]. Deposition testimony is entitled to the same consideration as live testimony, and you must judge it in the same way as if the witness was testifying in court.

Your decision must be based only on the evidence presented here. You must not be influenced in any way by either sympathy for or prejudice against anyone. You must follow the law as I explain it – even if you do not agree with the law – and you must follow all of my instructions as a whole. You must not single out or disregard any of the instructions on the law. The fact that a corporation is involved as a party must not affect your decision in any way. A corporation and all other persons stand equal before the law and must be dealt with as equals in a court of justice. When a corporation is involved, of course, it may act only through people as its employees; and, in general, a corporation is responsible under the law for the acts and statements of its employees that are made within the scope of their duties as employees of the company.

As I said before, you must consider only the evidence that I have admitted in the case. Evidence includes the testimony of witnesses and the exhibits admitted. But, anything the lawyers say is not evidence and isn’t binding on you. You shouldn’t assume from anything I’ve said that I have any opinion about any factual issue in this case. Except for my instructions to you on the law, you should disregard anything I may have said during the trial in arriving at your own decision about the facts. Your own recollection and interpretation of the evidence is what matters. In considering the evidence you may use reasoning and common sense to make deductions and reach conclusions. You shouldn’t be concerned about whether the evidence is direct or circumstantial. “Direct evidence” is the testimony of a person who asserts that he or she has actual knowledge of a fact, such as an eyewitness. “Circumstantial evidence” is proof of a chain of facts and circumstances that tend to prove or disprove a fact. There’s no legal difference in the weight you may give to either direct or circumstantial evidence.

When I say you must consider all the evidence, I don’t mean that you must accept all the evidence as true or accurate. You should decide whether you believe what each witness had to say, and how important that testimony was. In making that decision you may believe or disbelieve any witness, in whole or in part. The number of witnesses testifying concerning a particular point doesn’t necessarily matter. To decide whether you believe any witness I suggest that you ask yourself a few questions:

1. Did the witness impress you as one who was telling the truth?
2. Did the witness have any particular reason not to tell the truth?
3. Did the witness have a personal interest in the outcome of the case?
4. Did the witness seem to have a good memory?
5. Did the witness have the opportunity and ability to accurately
observe the things he or she testified about?
6. Did the witness appear to understand the questions clearly and
answer them directly?
7. Did the witness’s testimony differ from other testimony or other
evidence?

When scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge might be helpful, a person who has special training or experience in that field is allowed to state an opinion about the matter. But that doesn’t mean you must accept the witness’s opinion. As with any other witness’s testimony, you must decide for yourself whether to rely upon the opinion.

In this case it is the responsibility of the [Plaintiff] [party bringing any claim] to prove every essential part of [his/her/its] claim[s] by a “preponderance of the evidence.” This is sometimes called the “burden of proof” or the “burden of persuasion.”

A “preponderance of the evidence” simply means an amount of evidence that is enough to persuade you that [the Plaintiff’s] [the party’s] claim is more likely true than not true.

If the proof fails to establish any essential part of a claim or contention by a preponderance of the evidence, you should find against the Plaintiff.

When more than one claim is involved, you should consider each claim
separately.

In deciding whether any fact has been proved by a preponderance of the evidence, you may consider the testimony of all of the witnesses, regardless of who may have called them, and all of the exhibits received in evidence, regardless of who may have produced them.

If the proof fails to establish any essential part of the Plaintiff’s
claim[s] by a preponderance of the evidence, you should find for the Defendant as to that claim.

Of course, the fact that I have given you instructions concerning the issue of Plaintiff’s damages should not be interpreted in any way as an indication that I believe that the Plaintiff should, or should not, prevail in this case.

Your verdict must be unanimous – in other words, you must all agree. Your deliberations are secret, and you’ll never have to explain your verdict to anyone.

Each of you must decide the case for yourself, but only after fully considering the evidence with the other jurors. So you must discuss the case with one another and try to reach an agreement. While you’re discussing the case, don’t hesitate to reexamine your own opinion and change your mind if you become convinced that you were wrong. But don’t give up your honest beliefs just because others think differently or because you simply want to get the case over with. Remember that, in a very real way, you’re judges – judges of the facts. Your only interest is to seek the truth from the evidence in the case.

If you wish to communicate with me at any time, please write down your message or question and give it to the court security officer. The court security officer will bring it to me and I’ll respond as promptly as possible – either in writing or by talking to you in the courtroom. Please understand that I may have to talk to the lawyers and the parties before I respond to your question or message, so you should be patient as you await my response. But I caution you not to tell me how many jurors have voted one way or the other at that time.

The case before you is a tort case in which the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the negligence of the defendant was a proximate cause of the injuries to the plaintiff.

[Georgia Pattern Jury Instruction 60.001]

__ Given __ Refused

---

Request to Charge __

Proximate cause means that cause which, in a natural and continuous sequence, produces an event, and without which cause such event would not have occurred.

In order to be a proximate cause, the act or omission complained of must be such that a person using ordinary care would have foreseen that the event, or some similar event, might reasonably result therefrom. There may be more than one proximate cause of an event, but if an act or omission of any person not a party to the suit was the sole proximate cause of an occurrence, then no act or omission of any party could have been a proximate cause. When I use the expression "proximate cause," I mean a cause that, in the natural or ordinary course of events, produced the plaintiff's injury. It need not be the only cause, nor the last or nearest cause. It is sufficient if it combines with another cause resulting in the injury.

A person who enters the premises of another for any purpose connected with the business of the owner or occupier is an invitee, and the owner or occupier of the premises owes that person the duty to exercise ordinary care in keeping the premises safe. That duty would extend to all portions of the premises that are reasonably necessary for the invitee to use in the course of the business for which the invitation was given.

When the owner or occupier of land, by express or implied invitation, induces or leads others to come upon the premises for any lawful purpose, then the owner is liable in damages to such persons for injuries caused by the failure to exercise ordinary care in keeping the premises and approaches safe.

[Georgia Pattern Jury Instruction 60.620]

__ Given __ Refused

---

Request to Charge __

While not an insurer of the invitee's safety, the owner/occupier is required to exercise ordinary care to protect the invitee from unreasonable risks of harm of which the owner/occupier has superior knowledge. The owner/occupier owes persons invited to enter the premises a duty of ordinary care to have the premises in a reasonably safe condition and not expose the invitees to unreasonable risk (or to lead them into a dangerous trap). The owner/occupier is not required to warrant the safety of all persons from all things, but to exercise the diligence toward making the premises safe that a good business person is accustomed to use in such matters. The true ground of liability is the owner/occupier's superior knowledge of the perilous condition and the danger therefrom to persons coming upon the property. It is when the perilous condition is known to the owner and not known to the person injured that a recovery is permitted.

In order to prevail, the person injured, the plaintiff, must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the owner/occupier, the defendant, had actual or constructive knowledge of the hazard and that the plaintiff lacked knowledge of the hazard or for some reason, attributable to the defendant, was prevented from discovering it. To establish constructive knowledge, the plaintiff must show that (1) the defendant or the defendant's employee was in the immediate area of the hazard and could have easily seen the substance or (2) the foreign substance remained long enough that ordinary diligence by the defendant or the defendant's employees should have discovered it. Constructive knowledge may be inferred by you, the jury, when there is evidence that the owner lacked a reasonable inspection procedure, but if the plaintiff produces no evidence that the substance could have been discovered during a reasonable inspection, then no inference arises that the defendant's failure to discover the defect was the result of any alleged failure to inspect.

Damages are given as pay or compensation for injury done. When one party is required to pay damages to another, the law seeks to ensure that the damages awarded are fair to both parties.

You may determine the life expectancy of a person when the person's age is shown without any other direct evidence on the subject. In deciding this matter, you are also entitled to consider the evidence pertaining to the person's health, habits, surroundings, and method of living.

[Georgia Pattern Jury Charge 66.301.]

__ Given __ Refused

Request to Charge __

There is another way in which you may determine the life expectancy of the plaintiff. There has been introduced into evidence a copy of the Annuity Mortality Table for 1949, Ultimate mortality tables. If you desire to determine from this table the life expectancy of a person, look up that person's age in one column, and across from the age column, you will find the life expectancy of a person of that age. Life expectancy shown on any such table is merely a guide that you may follow while considering the evidence as a whole.

If you use the mortality tables, you should take the average annual loss of future income of the plaintiff and multiply it by the number of years of the plaintiff's life expectancy. The result will give you the probable gross loss of future earnings. You should then reduce the loss to its present cash value by using a rate of interest of 5 percent per annum as a reduction factor. If you find the plaintiff's loss of future earnings is not permanent but will be reduced for some period of time into the future, you should then disregard the mortality table and award to the plaintiff damages for loss of future earnings for such temporary period as you may find.

Pain and suffering is a legal item of damages. The measure is the enlightened conscience of fair and impartial jurors. Questions of whether, how much, and how long the plaintiff has suffered or will suffer are for you to decide. Mental Pain and suffering includes mental suffering, but mental suffering is not a legal item of damage unless there is physical suffering also. In evaluating the plaintiff's pain and suffering, you may consider the following factors, if proven: interference with normal living; interference with enjoyment of life; loss of capacity to labor and earn money; impairment of bodily health and vigor; fear of extent of injury; shock of impact; actual pain and suffering, past and future; mental anguish, past and future; and the extent to which the plaintiff must limit activities.

No plaintiff may recover for injuries or disabilities that are not connected with the act or omissions of the defendant in this case. There can be no recovery for a particular plaintiff for any injury or disability that was not proximately caused by the incident in question. If you should find that, at the time of the incident, the plaintiff had any physical condition, ailment, or disease that was becoming apparent or was dormant, and if you should find that the plaintiff received an injury as a result of the negligence of the defendant and that the injury resulted in any aggravation of a condition already pending, then the plaintiff could recover damages for aggravation of the preexisting condition.

The sick or diseased, as well as the healthy, may recover for injuries proximately caused by the negligence of another. The Defendant cannot complain that their conduct would have caused a healthy person less injury than it caused the Plaintiff. To cause a condition, or to aggravate or make it worse, is an injury for which damages are recoverable. Your damages award should include any aggravation or worsening of a pre-existing condition you find was caused by the Defendant’s negligence.
