Your honor, we're here on a dispossessory that is in default, my client has taken possession and I'm prepared to go forward with evidence on the question of damages.

I'd like to call Bill Bertram.

Mr. Bertram, could you please introduce yourself to the Court.

What is your relationship with Dawson Village, LLC

Are you authorized to testify on behalf of that entity today?

Are you generally familiar with the record keeping and business practices of that entity, which we'll call Dawson Village?

Can you tell me about your experience in the commercial real estate business

Does Dawson Village own property located in Dawson County, Georgia?

Could you tell the Court where that's located?

Is that what some people call the Old Kroger Mall, at 53 and 400?

I'm showing you what's been previously marked for identification purposes as Plaintiff's Exhibit A.

Are you familiar with this document?

Is this a true and correct copy of a document maintained in the regular course of business by Dawson Village with reference to its relationship with an entity called Legacy First Launch, LLC

Tender

How did Dawson Village come to be involved with this leasing agreement?

Is that the second amendment

You are an attorney, correct?

Is there a personal guaranty to this lease?

Is that at Exhibit E to the lease?

Who are the guarantors?

Are there any conditions or notice requirements?

Does it expire? [5 years past rent commencement date]

And when was the lease executed?

So in any event the rent commencement date was not more than five years ago?

Did there come a time that Legacy First Launch, LLC defaulted on its obligations under the lease agreement?

Did you communicate with the tenant?

Was a written demand for possession made?

And was a decision ultimately made to file suit for possession?

Have you communicated with the tenant or its agents since the Complaint was filed?

Do you know if they were served in this action?

Were the defendants all served?

Did a writ of possession issue?

Did Dawson Village in fact take possession of the property? On what date?

Tell me about the condition of the property.

Are attempts being made to market the property to perspective tenants?

Based on your experience in the industry, how long do you think it's likely to take to fill the space?

Is Dawson Village going to be able to fill the space for an equivalent rent? Why not?

What is the remaining term of the lease?

Has Dawson Village done anything to your knowledge to cancel the lease agreement?

Is Dawson Village entitled to continue collecting rent on its lease with Legacy First Launch, LLC, in your opinion?

In default of payment, is Dawson Village entitled to accellerate the rent?

When will the lease expire, as amended [August 31, 2031]

There is a rental deferrment described in the second amendment, can you explain how that was supposed to work?

Is Dawson Village seeking any damages for waste to the property?

Is Dawson Village seeking past due rent?

I'll show what's been previously marked for identification purposes as Exhibit B.

Are you familiar with this document, and can you identify it?

Who prepared this?

Did they do so under your supervision and instruction?

Was this document generated in the ordinary course of Dawson Village's business as a statement of amounts currently owed under the Lease agreement.

And that amount is...

Are you aware of any relevant offsets or deferrments?

Is Dawson Village seeking an additional amount of damages for future rent?

Under the lease, how should that be calculated?

[Lease at 8.1: "[A[ll Rent for the balance of the Lease Term shall be deemed immediately due and payable by Tenant to Landlord less the fair market rental value of Premises (including all amounts that would be deemed Rent hereunder) for the remainder of the term, such accelerated about being discounted to present value, together with all other expenses incurred by Landlord in regaining possession."]

In your experience, what is your understanding of the fair rental value of the premises at issue in this case?

What do you base that on?

What is the monthly amount that Legacy Launch would be paying if they were a tenant in good standing?

Would that increase over time?

Is the relevant table at paragraph 4 of the second amendment to the Lease?

Have you done the math to show a total?

What is that?

And if we reduce that by the anticipated fair market rental value, what do you get?

And then, if we reduce that to present value based on an annual rate of simple interest of seven percent as provided in OCGA ยง 7-4-2(a)(1)(A), what are we left with?

So past due rent plus future rent calculated as provided in the lease leaves us with what?

Does Dawson Village also have any expenses incurred in regaining possession?

Are you familiar with my firm's invoices, up to the date of possession?

Is Dawson Village also entitled to recover the attorney fees it incurs in relation to this hearing?

If I represent to you stating in my place that I spent about two and a half hours preparing for today's hearing, does that seem fair to you?

Are you familiar with my hourly rate?

In your experience, is that a reasonable and customary rate for legal services in the legal market where this litigation is being conducted?

And has the amount of time I've spent on this file seemed reasonable you?

So, overall, past rent, shortfall of future rent reduced to present value, and attorney fees. What is Dawson Village asking for as damages against the defendants in this action?
