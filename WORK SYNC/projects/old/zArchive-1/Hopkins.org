This is the deposition of Bruce Roeder, taken by videoconference by agreement of the parties, for discovery and any other lawful purposes and with objections reserved until the first lawful use of the transcript. The action is pending in the State Court of Cobb County. Does anyone have anything they want to put on the record before we swear the witness?

{swear}

Good morning, Mr. Roeder, my name is Paul Menair and I'm a plaintiff's attorney representing an individual who was injured in a collision with an employee of Baldwin Paving, Inc. My understanding from discovery responses that were provided by Baldwin Paving, Inc. is that you were the safety director at the time of the collision, in January of 2022, is that correct?

I'll have questions for you mainly in that capacity, but first I have some things we go over with every witness. Have you ever attended a deposition or given sworn testimony in any capacity before today?

You are under oath, and you understand what that means, yes?

I tend to move through my outline pretty expeditiously, but if you ever need a break for any reason, the only thing I will ask is that you give me an answer to any question I've already asked before you go on mute, okay?

Who if anyone is in the room with you?

We are all used to these videoconferences at this point, but please try to keep in mind that we're trying to get a transcript of the call, and it helps the reporter if we both try not to talk to each other, okay?

I also will need a spoken, articulate answer to any questions instead of a gesture or the type of noise that people make in casual conversations, so if I ask you to clarify an answer for the court reporter, please understand that I'm trying to get a clear transcript and I'm not just being a stickler for some sort of protocol, okay?

If for any reason you don't understand a question, please let me know and I will try to restate it for you.

Did you meet with anyone to prepare for today's deposition?

Who was in the meeting?

Did you review any documents?

Alright, let's talk about you for a second. Where are you from?

According to LinkedIn you graduated from the University of Akron in 1999 with a Bachelor's Degree in Chemical Engineering, is that correct?

And then you worked for a company in Solon, Ohio for about 11 years as a project manager, yes?

POLY-CARB?

What do they do?

And what was your role there as a project manager?

Then you left to go to Jacksonville Florida to work for a company called DBI Services?

Why did you leave Ohio?

You worked in Florida for two and a half years.

Similar position?

Then from there you went with Baldwin Paving in the fall of 2013.

Why leave Florida after only a couple of years?

You've been with Baldwin Paving for about a decade now, yes?

Have you been in more or less the same role that whole time?

Describe what you do for the company?

Who do you report to?

Who reports to you?

Where is your office located? [1014 Kenmill Drive, NW, Marietta, GA, 30060-7911, USA]

Who is Beverly Cusac? Role?

Who is John B Harrison, Jr.? Role

Matthew Wardlaw?

How long has Baldwin Paving been in business? [1979]

What do you know about the history of the company?

What does Baldwin Paving do? [asphalt, concrete, grading]

The website lists a number of plant facilities, including one in Cumming at 1535 Ronald Reagan. What happens at the facilities?

Is the Kenmill Drive address just an administrative office?

So you've been identified to us a the safety director for Baldwin Paving, Inc., is that an accurate description of what you do, in your opinion?

In addition to your engineering bachelors, walk me through any training you've had relevant to your role as safety director?

Do you have any certificates or licenses?

Have you ever held an engineering license in Georgia or any other state?

Do you attend any regular trainings or conferences related to being a safety director?

Do you subscribe to any publications relating to being a safety director, or to the paving industry?

The USDOT thinks that Baldwin Paving has 95 power units associated with its DOT number, which I'll represent for the record is 867394. Does 95 sound about correct?

What types of vehicle are we talking about, that are identified as USDOT power units.

Are there vehicles owned by the company that are not in that USDOT fleet?

In the collision we're here about today, the accident report says that Mr. Nelson was driving a Ford F250 Super D belonging to Baldwin Paving Company.

Have you reviewed that accident report?

Do you know if the Baldwin Paving Company referenced in the report is the same as Baldwin Paving Company, Inc. that you work for?

How do you know for sure?

Are you familiar with the specific vehicle we're here about today?

Did you see it before or after the accident or both?

Can you tell me whether it had any markings on the door or anywhere else identifying it as Baldwin Paving property?

Describe?

Was that USDOT number displayed anywhere?

Do you happen to know what the gross vehicle weight of that vehicle is?

[9,900#]

How did you find out about the collision we're here about today?

What did you do to investigate what happened?

How did you first hear about what happened?

Did you visit the site?

Did anyone from Baldwin?

What did the company do, as opposed to you? I'm asking about Baldwin Paving, not the insurance companies.

Who have you talked to about the collision?

Have you put anything in writing, anywhere, about this collision?

Any email, other than scheduling time to talk to attorneys or this deposition?

Did you make a report?

I'm going to show you a document. We'll mark this as Plaintiff's Exhibit 1.

Are you familiar with this document?

Looking all the way at the end, there's something called a verification. Is that your signature?

Who notarized this?

And this basically says that facts in the response portion of the document, to the extent they are provided, are true to the best of your knowledge, fair?

Specifically, what did you do to assist the lawyers in preparing these interrogatory responses?

How did you go about getting information?

Where are the records of Baldwin Paving maintained?

You have a desktop computer, or a laptop, or both?

I'm going to go through this, mostly to see if anything has changed, but I may have some follow up questions.

Rather than read the questions into the record I will be paraphrasing, if I say anything that you think isn't a fair paraphrase, please let me know, okay?

1 asks about witnesses, and this asks for anyone who might know anything about the case, including both liability issues and my client's damages, okay?

And the response just basically identifies the people in the police report, and any other first responders, right?

Okay, fair enough. There are some other folks I'd like to know about, and I won't ask you to agree that they have discoverable information, these are just people I have questions about because I think might know something relevant to the case, okay?

[ ] employees who were working there that day

And please realize I haven't had a chance to talk to Mr. Nelson yet.

Who was Mr. Nelson's supervisor?

Do you know what Nelson was doing in Forsyth County that day?

Who would he have talked to at the job site?

Who would have been responsible for any safety training the Mr. Nelson may have participated in? Who conducted it, who designed it?

Who hired him?

He is no longer working there, correct?

Was he terminated? By who? Why?

I may have some more questions about witnesses, but let's move on.

6 asks about other legal actions.

You've been with Baldwin for about a decade.

Have you ever been involved in any other lawsuits relating to traffic accidents involving Baldwin Paving employees.

Would you have been?

In other words, your role as safety director involved responding to interrogatories in this case, would you have been the guy in other cases, if they went to litigation?

Have you ever testified before, in deposition or in court, about any traffic accident involving Baldwin Paving employees.

I'll represent that the USDOT says that, out of a fleet of 95, there were 5 reportable crashes in the 24 months prior to May 21 of this year, 4 of which involved a tow and only 1 of which involved an injury. Does that sound correct?

Are you involved in making those reports?

Are there ever any traffic incidents that fleet vehicles are involved in that aren't reported to the USDOT?

Was this crash reported?

Those are only crashes involving vehicles over #10,000, right?

So this was not the one with the injury, or do you know?

Can you tell me anything about the other DOT reported incidents, those five?

How badly was the one person injured?

And that is only people who are treated immediately at the scene, correct?

So some of those other 5 could have involved injuries that were not treated at the scene, yes?

Can you tell me how many unreported crashes there were during that two year period, either because they invovled motor vehicles that aren't covered by the motor carrier safety act like the one we're here about or for whatever reason?

How about for the five year period from today?

Do you keep records from which that information might be derived?

How and where?

Are you require by law to keep incident records?

What specifically?

Even if you are not required by law, are you required by best practices among safety directors of companies with vehicle fleets?

Number 8. Is the vehicle back in service? Where is it?

Number 9. Have you guys been able to determine what Mr. Nelson's cell phone carrier was at the time of the incident? We'd like to get those records.

Do you know when Mr. Nelson stopped working for Baldwin? Why?

He just had a Class C license, yes?

[ ] BOTH phone numbers and carriers

11. Why was Mr. Nelson there that day?

    You said you didn't know who he was there to talk to?

    You say there are no logs. Are there any work records that would at least show when he started work that day?

    How about mileage logs for the vehicle? [service]

[ ] field logs - B2W - [ ] 

    Any way we could reconstruct what was in the vehicle that day?

    Did he carry tools?

    Who paid for gas? How are those records kept?

    There was no reason why he would be carrying anything but tools, correct?

    No gravel, asphalt, hazardous materials, heavy equipment, anything like that?

    What was going on in Gainesville? Who was he going to see there?

13. We'll look at the policy manual in a bit. What is the company policy about post-accident testing, in your words?

In your opinion as safety director, should testing have been conducted? Why not? Why wasn't it?

14. Who at Baldwin has talked to Mr. Nelson about the collision? Are there any other Baldwin employees who know anything about the collision, directly or indirectly? Do y'all know who was at the Forsyth County site that day who might have seen it?

Mr. Nelson was pulling out of an area that was blocked off by cones, yes?

What work was being done in that area?

Who was working in that area? Any way to find out?

[look again at accident report]

15. Did you talk to anyone who helped you respond to these interrogatories?

Have you talked to Mr. Nelson?

What's going on with him, health wise?

16. We asked about the repair condition of the vehicle and the response was that wasn't relevant.

    Do you know what the repair condition of the vehicle was?

    Do you have reason to believe that the mechanical condition of the vehicle was not related to the collision in any way?

    How do you know?

    If it becomes relevant, for whatever reason, are those records available?

17. You don't do any telemetry on these F250s? How about other vehicles in the fleet?

19. This is your testimony, based on your belief about how the collision happened, correct? How did you form that belief? Anything that we haven't talked about that influences your understanding of how the collision happened?

    You don't have any direct knowledge of how the collision happened though, correct?

    Have you talked to an accident reconstructionist about this wreck?

    Do you have any training in accident reconstruction?

RFD 4 Are there any documents that refer to Mr. Nelson's work activities on the DAY of the collision?

How about the day before?

Like, could we reconstruct when he got off work the day before and started work that day, and where he was say, that day, and the day before?

Would you be willing to provide those documents?

Mr. Nelson was not a covered driver under the motor vehicle safety act, correct?

So you didn't have a medical qualifications file for him, for example.

Did you get a driving record for him?

What does Baldwin Paving do to be sure an employee is a safe driver before entrusting a motor vehicle to him or her?

Is any testing conducted?

[ ] MVR

Tell me about training? How, how often, how recorded, what materials, classroom only?

What is your understanding of what the law requires of the company for drivers like Mr. Nelson.

Does your insurance company have any of its own requirements? Documentated?

Has your insurance company ever conducted any safety audits or reviews relating to fleet and traffic safety?

Does Baldwin Paving have a safety department? Who?

Does it hold meetings? How often? Documented?

In general, how are decisions about policy and procedures relating to safety made? Who is involved? And how are those decisions documented?

Have you emailed anyone, or communicated with anyone by text, regaring this accident or this case? Other than lawyers and insurance adjusters.

Have you talked to anyone, not a lawyer or an insurance adjuster, that we haven't discussed.

Ex. 2

I'm showing you what we'll be marking Ex 2, it consists of a document produced by Baldwin Paving with Bates # Defendants 000147-290. I'm not entirely sure this is one coherent document, but we'll go through and refer to the bates numbers as we go, fair?

This first page at bates 147 is a title page saying that this is a Baldwin Paving Safety and Health Manual, yes?

And the date is September 2021.

Are you familiar with this document?

What was your role in creating or updating this document?

You folks produced another manual dated June of 2022, so my conclusion is that this September 2021 document is the one that would have been in effect in January of 2022, is that correct?

Are there other documents that contain health and safety policies of Baldwin Paving that you're aware of, or is this the only place to look, other than government regulations and the like?

154 Please read the first paragraph of the Policy Statement

Baldwin's policies are intended to create a safe workplace for employees, yes?

But also the public.

At the bottom here there is a reference to OSHA, correct?

Can you think of any other government regulations or standards that are consulted in preparing this policy?

155-56 Bruce Roeder, that's you, correct?

And this says you are responsible for this manual, and there is also a Safety Administrator who supports you.

Who was that in January 2022. Now.

Then there are project managers, superintendants, and foreman.

Who are the relevant people who were responsible for Mr. Nelson in January of 2022.

157 Was Mr. Nelson a "Driver" for purpose of this policy in January of 2022?

And as far as the operation of his vehicle, the relevant documents are first, any state and federal law regarding vehicles on public road and, second, the "Rules for Drivers" portion of this document.

158 Progressive discipline

Does this apply to Drivers?

What discipline was imposed on Mr. Nelson.

160 training - any training Mr. Nelson received from Baldwin regarding safety would be recorded in his file, yes?

162 accident reports within 1 hour

They go to you, yes.

Kept in your office?

This includes Drivers?

178 Rules for Drivers

What does adequate training consist of?

How was Mr. Nelson's use of a company vehicle authorized? "Proper?"

Have you reviewed the accident report in this case?

Have you reviewed Mr. Nelson's report, which we'll look at in a moment?

Have you spoken with Mr. Nelson?

Do you believe that Mr. Nelson complied with or violated this policy on January 31, 2022.

Why?

Nelson wasn't pulling a trailer, right?

What does the Substance Abuse Program require in the case of a motor vehicle accident?

Was that complied with?

194, same policy, repeated in a different section, yes?

This is the shop, year, lab, and office specific policy.

Does not apply to Nelson, right?

239 Vehicle Safety

This applied to Nelson, right?

Was his driving record reviewed twice a year per policy?

Did he maintain a maintenance log?

Was the vehicle inspected?

What is a Supervisor's Report of Accident?

Was one prepared in this case?

Was it produced?

Were any changes made to any of these policies as a consequence of the collision that Nelson was involved in?

Let's look at what I'll have her mark as Exhibit 3.

starting at Bates 368, is this Mr. Nelson's Incident Report?

It gives a time of incident.

Does it say when the form was filled out?

In fact, I don't even see a date.

So how can I be sure about the timing of this?

You have a policy of obtaining reports within an hour.

But it doesn't look like you track that.

What is BP-2206

It says he reported to his supervisor, but it doesn't say who his supervisor was.

Who was his supervisor?

Would it be fair to say that there isn't really a lot of detail in this report?

Next at 370 is a document titled Employee Statement. Is this meant to be filled out contemporaneously?

This one is dated, the same day as the accident, yes?

Were you present when this form was filled out?

Who else?

Okay, so Mr. Nelson submitted a blank statement.

It doesn't even give the name of the other employee involved, although we'll see who that was in a second.

And there's no description.

Who permitted him to submit this?

Was any attempt made to get him to supplement this?

What is the point of obtaining a written statement when employees are permitted to provide statements containing no information?

371 Supervisor incident report, not filled out.

Why not?

372 Cameron Evans

What is his relationship with Mr. Nelson? [step-father]

Why was he in the vehicle

[ ] depose Evans

This provides a little bit more information.

Was Mr. Evans injured in the collision?

Do you know whether he made an injury claim of any sort?

[ ] (404) 630-3301 Titanium Wireless John Nelson and/or Baldwin Paving {personal cell?}

[ ] get citation disposition 2022-011267 3209981 Failure to Yield

Ex 4 starting with 375 These appear to me to be the safety training documents from Mr. Nelson's file.

377 this acknowledges taht he received a copy of the Health and Safety Manual

And that's what we looked at earlier

380 This shows library material

What relates to driving?

[ ] can I get a copy of Defensive Driving for Noncommercial Motorists? as of 3/30/21? - screenshot by screenshot

Is there anything about driving in the New EMployee Safety Orientation?

who is Eduardo Lopez

what qualifies him to teach defensive driving?

do you have any specific qualifications regarding defensive driving?

classroom or field?

Are there any comapny policies relating to driving that we haven't talked about?

Is there anything about the incident itself that we haven't talked about?

I don't see where there are any driving records obtained for Mr. Nelson, were they just not produced or did you not get those?

[ ] MVRs

Did you have any personal knowledge of Mr. Nelson's driving ability prior to the collision?

Is there anyone who would have?

Did you know whether he had any traffic citations prior to the collision?

Should you have known?

Do you know anything about his driving record now?

How about Mr. Lopez?

Were there any red flags about Mr. Nelson, with regard to safety, prior to the collision?

Did Mr. Nelson comply with company policy regarding driver safety?

Reporting?

Do you have any concerns about Vertical Earth's involvement in this collision?
