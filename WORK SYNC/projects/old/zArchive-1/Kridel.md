PLAINTIFF'S BRIEF IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS' MCDONALD'S CORPORATION, MCDONALD'S USA, LLC, AND MCDONALD'S REAL ESTATE COMPANY’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

COMES NOT the above Plaintiff and files his Brief in Opposition to Defendants' McDonald's Corporation, McDonald's USA, LLC, and McDonald's Real Estate Company’s Motion for Summary Judgment, showing the following:

I. Facts

This is an action for personal injuries arising from a slip and fall incident at a McDonald's restaurant located in Dahlonega, Georgia (the "Premises"). (Defendants' Statement of Material Facts ["DSMF"] at ¶¶ 1-2.) At all times material hereto, the Premises were operated by Northeast Georgia, Inc. as franchisee of McDonald's Corporation, McDonald's USA, LLC, and/or McDonald's Real Estate Company (collectively "McDonald's" or "Movants"). (Affidavit of Robert W. Swoszowski, attached to DSMF as Exhibit A thereto, at ¶ 4; DSMF at ¶¶ 1 and 3; Deposition of Kimberly Scott ["Scott Depo."] at 11, 21.) The Premises were and are owned by McDonald's Real Estate Company, which leases them to Northeast Georgia, Inc.. (Tax Assessor's Record, visited November 29, 2023, attached as Exhibit A; Warranty Deed, attached as Exhibit B.)[fn][Plaintiff anticipates that Defendants will stipulate to this fact and the undersigned states in his place that it is consistent with documents produced by Defendants and subject to a confidentiality order in this action. In the event this fact is contested Plaintiff requests leave of court to file relevant documents under seal.]

Krystle Yvette Ives ("Ives") was at the time of her deposition and the incidents alleged herein the general manager of the Premises. (Deposition of Krystle Yvette Ives ["Ives Depo."] at 6-7.) Ives is an employee of Northeast Georgia, Inc. and reports to one of their area supervisors. (Ives Depo. at 8-9.) According to Ives, McDonald's employees makes regular visits to the restaurant she manages to inspect the store for safety, quality, and cleanliness, and to ensure overall operation of the store consistent with the McDonald's brand. (Ivie Depo. at 11.) These visits occur at least quarterly, but may be more frequent if a store is identified as a cause for concern. (Ivie Depo. at 11.)

McDonald's also provides training, which always incorporates concern for safety. (Ivie Depo. at 12.)
(Ivie Depo. at 13.) The general policies and procedures for operation of the Dahlonega location are provided by McDonald's and have not been adapted or altered by Northeast Georgia, Inc. (Ivie Depo. at 29-30.) These polices include policies relating to cleaning, maintenance, and the prevention of slip and fall accidents. (Ivie Depo. at 30-32.)

II. Argument and Citation of Authorities

Summary judgment is permissible if, and only if, "no genuine dispute exists as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." OCGA § 9-11-56. Here, Plaintiff has asserted claims of both premises liability and ordinary negligence.

OCGA § 51-3-1 provides that "[w]here an owner or occupier of land, by express or implied invitation, induces or leads others to come upon his premises for any lawful purpose, he is liable in damages to such persons for injuries caused by his failure to exercise ordinary care in keeping the premises and approaches safe." The McDonald's entities allege herein that they cannot be subject to liability in this action because they were not the owners or occupiers of the premises, which were, they allege, controlled by their franchisee. Their motion does not address Plaintiff's ordinary negligence claim.

The testimony of Northeast Georgia, Inc.'s manager shows that the McDonald's entities (one of which, contra Defendant's contentions in their brief, was actually the record owner of the property) had maintained actual, continuing, and material control over the safety policies of Northeast Georgia, Inc. at that location and, significantly, performed regular inspections of the premises for safety. This is not a case of an absentee or mere out-of-possession landlord, but an active franchise arrangement, in which Northeast Georgia, Inc. acted as McDonald's brand representative subject to its control. Plaintiff submits that the premises duty should extend to a franchisor and actual and apparent agent under these circumstances where active control is retained, and Defendants provide no authority to the contrary and no testimony to the contrary other than the bare, conclusory assertions contained in an affidavit, which are contradicted by the actual testimony of a manager. See generally Rothberg v. Bradley, 85 Ga. App. 477 (1952) (landlord retaining control and supervision of property may be liable under the premises liability statute).

Moreover, setting aside the issue of premises liability, it is at least clear that McDonald's has in this case undertaken to perform oversight, training, policy-making, and inspection of these premises, and having done so may be held liable in simple negligence for failing to do so with reasonable care. Huggins v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 245 Ga. 248 (1980) ("One who undertakes, gratuitously or for consideration, to render services to another which one should recognize as necessary for the protection of a third person or one’s things, is subject to liability to the third person for physical harm resulting from one’s failure to exercise reasonable care to protect one’s undertaking if (a) one’s failure to exercise reasonable care increases the risk of such harm, or (b) one has undertaken to perform a duty owed by the other to the third person, or (c) the harm is suffered because of reliance of the other or the third person upon the undertaking.").

The present motion lacks merit and should be denied.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully prays that that the motion be denied and that the Court grant such other and further relief as it deems proper and just.

PLAINTIFF'S RESPONSE TO STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS

COMES NOW the above Plaintiff and responds to the statement of material facts presented by Defendants' McDonald's Corporation, McDonald's USA, LLC, and McDonald's Real Estate Company’s in support of their Motion for Summary Judgment as follows:

(hereinafter “restaurant”). (Plaintiff's Complaint at ¶¶ 9-11).

RESPONSE: Not controverted for purpose of the present motion.

3. At the time of the incident, the restaurant was operated by Co-Defendant Northeast
