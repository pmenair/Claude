# Outline

This is the deposition of Barbara Castle taken pursuant to notice and agreement under the federal rules, with objections reserved until the first lawful use and agreement of counsel as to remote administration of the oath. Any preliminary matters?

Ms. Castle, this shouldn't take to long. I represent the plaintiff in a lawsuit agaist Concrete Pump Partners, Inc. We're doing this remotely, so it's important that we try to speak clearly and not interrupt each other, okay?

Did you review any documents to prepare for today's deposition?

Let's start by talking about you for a bit. Where are you from, originally?

How long have you been working for Concrete Pump Partners? [where prior?]

What is your current position there?

Did you hire on in that position or work your way up?

Who was in the position in August of 2020?

How about when Trevor Skiles hired in 2018?

Looking through his personnel file as it was produced to me I see acknowledgement of receipt of an employee manual in February of 2021. That was after August of 2020, correct?

Was there an employee manual prior to that date?

Would you produce? [both]

Also a copy of the controlled substance and alcohol policy. When did that start? Can I get a copy?

How familiar are you with how things were done prior to when you took over?

Who is Samantha Langston? Still employed at CPP?

Ex 1-4 I am going to put into the record four documents rpoduced to us in discovery as Mr. Skiles' personnel records.

Let's go through them.

Did you assist counsel in producing these?

Is this the company's complete file on Mr. Skiles?

It says redacted, and I note that SSN have been redacted. Do you know if these were just redacted for PII or was other material taken out?

Employment Application 1/19

Is this the application for a commercial driver position?

How different?

Was he initially hired for a non-driving position?

When he transferred to a driving position, should he have reapplied?

What is supposed to happen when someone hires on to drive commercial?

Was any of that done in Mr. Skiles' case?

Do you know why not?

DOT test 3/1 this is a drug test, yes?

Can you tell me why and how it was conducted in 2018?

Nothing to do with our 2020 accident, correct?

3/3 this looks like the chain of custody on the same test, yes?

3/17 This looks like the results of the drug test on the date of the collision we're here about today, correct?

No chain of custody?

No alcohol test in the file, correct?

Do you know whether one was conducted?

Why was this querry conducted?

Who is April Ezell?

4/5 another negative test in 2023 same event?

4/9 Medical Examiner's Certificate signed November 2018 and good for two years

you keep these to document that your commercial drivers are medically qualified, yes?

That's a federal requirement?

4/13 review of driving record

who requires you to maintain these

Walk me through what Westfield required you guys to do as far as record keeping for insured commercial drivers in 2020? Has that changed?

Who conducts the review of driving records? 

Does the company every review a record and decide someone can't drive anymore?

Who makes that decision?

What are the guidelines?

Are they in writing?

Does the insurance company participate in this decision making? In setting the policy?

4/25 another drug test

Any idea what triggered this one?

I don't see any alcohol testing in the file at all.
