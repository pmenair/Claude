MOTION FOR LEAVE TO DROP PARTY

COMES NOW the above Plaintiff and, pursuant to OCGA § 9-11-21, respectfully requests leave of court to file an amended pleading dropping Bobby Bagley as a party to this action, showing the following:

1. This civil matter was filed on April 4, 2019, in which it was alleged that Latasha Chevalier and Bobby Bagley conspired to defraud Plaintiff by obtaining dental services for Ms. Chevalier and then initiating a chargeback on Mr. Bagley's credit account.

2. Upon discovery, it now appears that the account that the person who allegedly represented himself to Ms. Chevalier as Bobby Bagley was not the true owner of the account and was actually a person as yet unidentified making fraudulent use of Mr. Bagley's credit account. Deposition of Latasha Chevalier, extract attached as Exhibit A, at 15-17, 36-37.

3. Accordingly, Plaintiff respectfully requests leave of Court to drop Bobby Bagley as a party to this action.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully prays that the motion be granted and that the Court grant such other and further relief as it deems proper and just.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.

Chevalier was served, Bagley is dead? (refile deadline was 2019-05-09)

Bobby Lionel Bagley passed away 2017-07-13. Notice to creditors was
published 2017-09-06. Discharge 2018-03-07. CareCredit transaction date
was 2017-09-25. Looks like the initial client visit was 2017-05-11. She
got sent for some perio in July, then back to Goldstein for the
restoration work in August/September. So it's possible they called
Bagley on that first visit. But the actual transaction was run two
months after date of death.

Imposter Bagley? The guy she knew was black.

This is the deposition of Jasmine Spears, taken pursuant to subpoena and agreement of the witness under the Georgia Civil Practice Act for all allowable purposes under the act. I propose that all objections except to form and responsiveness of the answer be reserved until the first lawful use of the deposition, and we also are taking this deposition remotely with the court reporter outside of the physical presence of the witness. Hearing no objection to these stipulations, I will proceed unless anyone wants to say something for the record before we swear the witness.

Madame Court Reporter, if you could swear the witness please.

Ms. Spears, my name is Paul Menair, and I represent Goldstein Dental in litigation against Latasha Chevalier. Thank you for making the time to be with us today, I'll try to keep this as brief as possible.

Could you state your full name for the record, and spell your last name, please.

What is your date of birth.

I'm going to go off of the record for a moment.

Could you tell me your social security number off the record, please. 120744481

Thank you.

Back on the record, I'll represent that Ms. Spears (did-didnot) provide me with a social security number.

Could you tell me your current address. 6212 Queen Meadow

Where else have you lived in the last 10 years? 683 Florence Place

What's a good phone number for you. 404-697-3531

Who lives with you, currently? Chanel Davis 13yo 

Do you have any relatives in Fulton County?

Do you attend church in Fulton County? Clubs?

What was your highest level of education? Degree? Year? 

Where are you currently employed? What do you do there? 

Prior to that? 

Were you employed by Goldstein Dental PC in September of 2017?

What was your job title?

Who reported to you? Who did you report to?

What were your duties on an average day?

As part of your duties, were you involved in transactions on CareCredit or Synchrony Bank accounts?

Tell me about that.

Do you recall a patient or client named Latasha Chevalier?

Do you recall anything about the interaction between Goldstein Dental and CareCredit regarding payment for treatment rendered to Latasha Chevalier, specifically?

Let's go back to generalities for a moment. When a patient came in and wanted to pay with CareCredit, how did the actual transaction work?

Did you need to see an actual card?

Did you need a signature?

Did you actually check the signature in any way?

Do you recall the Chevalier transaction? Who would have processed it?

Did you know Ms. Chevalier?

Deborah ?
Priscilla A? and another

Did you know Bobby Bagley?

Do you recall anything about Bobby Bagley?

Let's look at what I'm going to have the court reporter mark as Exhibit 1, this was an exhibit to a previous deposition.

Are you familiar with CareCredit sales drafts?

Are these printed out in the office for signature?

It looks like at the bottom there's a web address for a portal at CareCredit, correct? 

Tell me how these are generated?

Have you ever seen this specific document? 

Do you know who's signature that is?

Does it look to you like it says Bobby Bagley?

Can you explain how it happened that someone other than Bobby Bagley might have signed this?

I'll represent that we have documents suggesting that Ms. Chevalier may have become an authorized user of the Bagley CareCredit account, do you recall that?

If you were in a situation where someone was an authorized user of someone else's CareCredit account, would the portal usually generate a document with the authorized user's name, or the original cardholder's name?

Can you explain what happened in this case?

I note that the bottom has a portion for ID verification and it is not filled out, correct?

Would this generally have been filled out? What was the standard operating procedure at Goldstein Dental?

Let's look at Exhibit 2

I know you don't recognize this, this is an internal document that the CareCredit folks use to keep track of contacts with providers and clients. I'm just going to use this to try and refresh your recollection about what happened with Ms. Chevalier, okay?

If you look at page 7, it looks like the widow of the real Mr. Bagley contacted CareCredit in October of 2017 to say someone had stolen her husband's identity to open a CareCredit account. I'm not asking you to say whether that's really what happened, I'm just asking if you recall any communications with CareCredit around that time about this account?

On Page 6, it says that Jasmine Spears called and told that that Latasha Chevalier was an authorized user of the account and that she'd confirmed that with CareCredit. Does that refresh your recollection about anything?

On Page 4, towards the bottom, I think it says that on November 21, 2017, they charged back 9811.30 "Due to unauthorized signature." Does that refresh your recollection?

Did the office obtain an authorized signature? Why not.

Let's look at Exhibit 3.

This is a letter from Jasmine Spears to the fraud department at CareCredit. Are you familiar with this letter?

Tell me how this letter came about.

In this letter, you say that you "ran the payment and had her sign." I think the her here refers to Ms. Chevalier, is that how you read it?

So you're saying you had Ms. Chevalier sign the draft that we saw earlier?

Now, the signature line on the sales draft says Bobby Bagley, not Latasha Chevalier.

And the signature doesn't look like Bobby Bagley or Latasha Chevalier.

Did you check the signature.

I'll represent to you that Ms. Chevalier testified at her deposition that she didn't sign that document.

Is she lying?

Let's look at Exhibit 4

Do you recall this document?

Do you know if the practice did anything to appeal CareCredit's decision?

Do you know Ms. Chevalier other than as a patient at Goldstein?

What can you tell me about her?

Do you know anyone named Bobby Bagley?

Lonnikah Holmez, with a z?

Brittany Wayne?

Damion Donaldson?

Danielle Beckham?

[] phone records

[] Dr Perlow and dental assistant might know (M), his dental assistant was involved and would have been in the room when the signature was obtain.

What do you think happened with this transaction?

Who could I talk to to find out more?

Any idea how I might go about finding the individual who represented himself to y'all as Bobby Bagley?

Were there ever any patients at Goldstein Dental that you didn't bill or provided complementary service to?

How was that authorized?

Was it, in every instance?

Were you terminated from Goldstein Dental?

Why?

Did you appeal your termination?

Why not?

Did you know Mary Ra other than as a colleague at work?

Did you know her before you went to work at Goldstein?

The letter you sent indicated you filed a police report, tell me about that?

Did the police follow up?

Did you follow up with the police?

[] remember she declined the insurance coverage for the cosmetic work
