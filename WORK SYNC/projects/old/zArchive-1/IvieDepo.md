# Everado Arellano

Could you please state and spell your full name for the record.

What is your position with Senor Fiesta?

What company name is on your paycheck?

Who do you report to? Title?

How many direct reports do you have? What are their names?

Tell me a little bit about how you came to work for Senor Fiesta, and how you got to be where you are today with the company?

I know you probably met with counsel to prepare for today's deposition, and I don't want to know anything that was said in that meeting, but I do want to know if you reviewed any documents, either in that meeting or in general, to prepare for today?

Did you meet with anyone other than counsel to get ready for today's deposition?

Let's start with my client's fall. How, personally, did you come to learn about my client's fall?

Who have you talked to about the fall?

We'll come back to this in detail later, but what is your understanding of what happened?

There were interrogatory responses filed on behalf of both entities. Were you involved in preparing those responses? Who else was? Did you review them for today?

Who is Domitla Hernandez (404) 542-4184; Maricela Arellano (678) 936-3812; Jennifer Alvarez (678) 906-1418. What does she know that is relevant to my client's fall? How do you know? Have you spoken with her. What is her job at Senor Fiesta? What are her job duties relating to falls and the prevention of falls? Did she perform those duties properly?

Other witnesses

You provided some video and some still photographs, let's look at them?

Who preserved these?

My client was apparently sitting at C18, where is that?

Where did the fall happen?

Who preserved? Why four clips? Why blank portions?

prior incident

What should I be looking for in these clips? Do they show the fall? The area where the fall happened?

Let's look at the receipt

This is a lot of food for two people

There's a bud light and three 16 oz daiguiris, right?

Any other alcohol?

Did you guys overserve these folks?

Are you aware that they gave any indication any of them were intoxicated?

Would your server have served someone who was visibly intoxicated?

Do you have any idea what my client drank?

Tell me about the text message

In your interrogatories, it say you are attaching a copy of a report made by the manager of Senor Fiesta #3, but I don't believe that was produced.

Senor Fiesta #3 or #2?

Interrogatories also talk about safety training. Tell me how that works.

It says you repeat safety protocol at the beginning of every shift. What do you say.

There's some quoted language: 

“If you see any hazard in the restaurant regarding food safety, employee and guest safety, immediately report to the manager on duty. If there are any spills, immediately place a ‘caution wet floor’ sign and clean the spill. If there is any accident or incident whether personal or of a guest, it is important to report these to the manager on shift. Report any misfunction of any equipment in the restaurant to management as soon as possible.”

Where does that appear?

Any documents provided to employees containing these policies?

Anything posted at the restaurant?

Can I get copies? 

Was there a wet floor sign?

Who put it out?

How long had it been out?

Was it a spill, why was the sign out?

Is it visible in the video/pics?

Why not?

What do you think my client did to contribute to this fall?

There's a reference to a fall at #3 four or five years ago, tell me about that.

You were standing there?

Did you observe it?

Exactly where was the wet floor sign?

The written discovery states that there was a wet flor sign but no liquid was identified on the floor, that seems inconsistent?

Who looked for liquid?

Tell me about floor cleaning policies.

Who keeps the floor clean? How?

Are there employees specifically assigned to floor cleaning?

How often are the floors cleaned, setting aside spills. Cleaning the whole floor?

trip hazards in the area?

How is that conducted?

What happens when a spill is identified?

Was cleaning conducted?

Was there any warning prior to my client's fall of the condition, whatever it was, that caused her fall? When?

do you have any criticisms of the way that any of the employees responded to my client's fall?

After the fall, who talked to, client condition
