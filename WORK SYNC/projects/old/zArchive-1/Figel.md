# Jenny Figel v. GCA Education Services, Inc., State Court of Gwinnett County, Civil Action No. 20-C-04715-S5

This is the deposition of the designated corporate representative of GCA Education Services, Inc., taken pursuant to notice and agreement of counsel. Our understanding in prior depositions has been that objections are reserved until the first lawful use of the deposition, and that the witness will be under oath despite not being in the physical presense of the officer administering the oath. Is that still our understanding?

Do you want to make a record re signature?

Please swear the witness.

Good morning. Could you please state and spell your name for the record?

Are you the designated corporate representative for GCA Education Services, Inc.

Did you receive a copy of our notice of deposition, and did you review the topics in that notice?

Are you able to testify on those topics?

Are you authorized by GCA Education Services, Inc. to testify regarding those topics under oath?

Have you ever given a deposition before today?

Did you prepare for today's deposition by meeting with anyone?

Who was present at that meeting?

Did you review any documents?

Are you employed by GCA Education Services, Inc? In what capacity? How long?

Do you mind if we refer to that entity as just GCA?

Who do you report to at GCA? Who reports to you?

How many employees? Where is its headquarters?

Looking at the SEC filings, it looks like GCA is a subsidiary of GCS Services Group, Inc., which is a subsidiary of Grade Sub Two, LLC, which is a subsidiary of ABM Industries, Inc. I won't hold you to your answer, because I didn't notice these corporate governance issues as a topic, but does that sound correct?

There's been a name change.

Here's something that is relevant to the topics noticed for this deposition. Who sets policies and procedures regarding floor cleaning and prevention of slip and fall incidents? Is thatginternal to GCA, or does it filter down from above?

What persons are involved in setting those policies and procedures?

Are you personally involved in that? Where does your familiarity with GCA policies and procedures come from?

I'm going to go through GCA's discovery responses to start. I'm not going to show the actual document unless you ask me to, but I have it to screen share if you want, okay?

We asked for witnesses, and GCA identified Rosa Bonilla. Do you know how it was determined that Rosa Bonilla was a witness to the incident giving rise to this lawsuit? 

What documents exist that show Ms. Bonilla was working at the facility that day?

[] clock in

What documents record or memorialize anything relating to the incident, other than claim investigation documents that I assume your counsel contends are privileged?

Do you know whether a search was done for email or other correspondence relating to the incident?

Were there other employees at the facility that day, or the night before? Do you know who? Could you find out?

GCA's discovery responses state that GCA is self-insured up to 1MM, is that correct?

So there is no issue with coverage up to that limit, except of course that GCA denies liability, correct?

The response to Interrogatory 11 states that GCA inspects the restrooms each morning before school opens. Do you know who did that in the facility in question, on the day of the incident?

It was not Ms. Bonilla, correct?

And you can confirm for me that there are no inspection reports relevant to this incident, correct?

GCA does not maintain any cameras that might have recorded the incident.

And, to your knowledge, neither does the school system, correct?

Is it still true that no surveillance of my client has been conducted?

Interrogatory 13 asks, in essence, whether there are any other potentially liable parties, and GCA identifies the Plaintiff as contributorily negligent but no other persons or entities. Is that still correct, no non-party fault to GCA's knowledge?

Interrogatory 14 asks GCA how it thinks the incident happened. Part of the response is that there was a wet floor sign outside the restroom. There's been some discussion of this in the various depositions taken in this case. Other than Ms. Bonilla and my client, does GCA know about anyone who can testify regarding this sign? What evidence will GCA be able to introduce at trial to support this contention?

Any witnesses we haven't talked to that GCA is aware of who might be able to talk about whether there was water on the floor, and how it got there?

Interrogatory 16 asks about other slip and fall incidents, and GCA answered that there were none at that facility. Do you know how long GCA had been working at that facility?

GCA is a big company, and has had slip and fall incidents at other facilities, is that fair to say?

In fact, GCA has a person employees as with the title, "Director, Liability Claims," yes?

Some of those liability claims are slip and falls, yes?

Wet floors?

How many facilities does GCA work at, today? Was it more or less the same in August of 2019?

GCA's response to Interrogatory 20 suggests that GCA did not know about the incident until December of 2019, when it received a letter of representation from counsel. Is that correct?

Ms. Bonilla was aware my client fell, however, correct?

Did she notify anyone, do you know?

Are GCA employees supposed to report slip and falls? Why/Why not? How? How is policy communicated to them?

You can confirm, though, that no incident report was made, correct?

And there was no investigation prior to December of 2019, whatsoever?

Any GCA may have done a claim investigation after that, but that would have been in anticipation of litigation, correct?

Responding to Interrogatory 21, I'll represent GCA said that the school district was responsible for maintenance and GCA just cleaned the floor. True?

Does GCA contend that there was any issue with maintenance that led to my client slipping and falling?

How about design of the restroom, selection of flooring material, anything like that?

A floor cleaner has responsibility for preventing slip and fall incidents, correct?

That's why it's important to put out wet floor signs, right?

Do you know how many wet floor signs there were at this facility?

Walk me through how GCA employees were supposed to clean this floor, all of the relevant policies and procedures.

Do you believe that that those policies and procedures were followed the night before my client fell? Why?

How were policies and procedures communicated to employees? What did GCA do the ensure that they were followed? What kind of training is given as to how to clean floors? Is any written material distributed?

What are GCA's policies regarding discipline when people are injured in slip and fall incidents?

Is it possible that there was cleaning residue on the tile floor where my clients slipped that made it slippery? Why not?

Let's talk briefly about the answer. We originally sued ABM Industrices, and then substituted GCA as the proper party.

I don't believe GCA filed a separate answer, so it adopts the affirmative defenses from the original answer of ABM, correct?

The Tenth Affirmative Defense is incorporates all of the affirmative defenses in OCGA ยง 9-11-8, which is sort of a grab bag of defenses that you're supposed to include in your original pleading. Unless your lawyer is willing to withdraw this, I have to go through these and ask you if GCA still asserts these defenses:

[misnomer]

Accord and satisfaction, arbitration and award, discharge in bankruptcy, duress, estoppel, failure of consideration, fraud, illegality, injury by fellow servant, laches, license, payment, release, res judicata, statute of frauds, statute of limitations, and waiver.

There also was an affirmative defense that might include non-party fault, but we discussed that, correct?

Is Ms. Bonilla still employed by GCA? Why/why not?

Was anyone disciplined or terminated as a consequence of the incident involving my client?

Were any changes to policies or procedures implemented as a consequence of the incident involving my client?

GCA produced a redacted contract with Gainesville City School District dated 2014.

Is that the contract that governed its relationship with City of Gainesville in 2019?

Who is the custodian of that agreement, and where is it kept?

Who is GCA's contact person at City of Gainesville?

GCA did not produce any written policy or procedure documents, just the contract, the RFP, and some questions that were exchanged relating to the RFP, fair?

And you are not aware of any written material regarding how to wash a floor, policies for preventing slip and fall incidents, anything like that?

Has anything been generated since?

Does GCA still have the City of Gainesville contract?

Generally, are you aware of anything I haven't asked about that might be relevant to GCA's defense at trial?

Thank you for your time today.
