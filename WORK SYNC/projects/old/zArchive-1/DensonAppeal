TABLE OF AUTHORITIES

STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION

This is an appeal from a grant of summary judgment to the defendants in this matter by the Unitied States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. Both the final judgment and the final order granting entire summary judgment and disposing of all of Appellant's claims were entered [date] The Appellant herein timely filed her Notice of Appeal in the district court on [date] and, accordingly, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and 1294. The district court had subject matter jurisdiction of this action, which arose from a slip and and fall in a vacation rental home, on removal

STATEMENT OF ISSUES PRESENTED FOR REVIEW

1. Did the district court err in deciding that the Gerteisens qualify as out of possession landlords under O.C.G.A. § 44-7-14.

2. Did the district court err in deciding that Denson's defective construction and duty to repair claims fail as a matter of law.

{look at rules again for all of these subsections}

STATEMENT OF THE CASE

Plaintiff/Appellant Betty Denson (“Denson”) resides in Alabama with her husband; she has five children. (Deposition of Betty Denson (“Denson Depo.”), Doc. 46-1, at 8, 14-15.) On October 18, 2018, Denson was visiting Georgia and, with her family, rented a vacation rental property located at 515 Two Johns Way, Sautee Nacoochee, Georgia (the “Premises”). (Denson Depo. at 16, 36-37.) During her stay, she fell while going downstairs from an upstairs bedroom (the “Fall” on the “Staircase”). (Denson Depo. at 39-40.)

At the time of the Fall, the lights were on; she recalls that she stepping down and feeling like there was nothing to put her foot on, because of the way the Staircase treads narrow to a zero-wdith turn at the inside corner as they turn instead of coming to a landing. (Denson Depo. at 45, 47-49; see also Staircase Photo, Doc. 46-2.)

Plaintiff’s expert is qualified to give an opinion regarding the safety aspects of this staircase designed and provided both a report and deposition testimony on the subject. (Deposition of Timothy Satterfield [“Satterfield Depo.”] at 8-30, Doc. 46-3.) In the opinion of Mr.Satterfield, the Staircase was in violation of applicable codes and standards due to improper handrail dimension, improper handrail height at the transition where the Staircase turns, and a common walkline with too small of a minimum inside tread width along handrail side. (Satterfield Depo. at 75-95, 103-106.)

At the time of the Fall, Defendants were the owners of the Premises. (Defendants’ Statement of Material Facts (“Defs. SMF”), Doc. 43-2, at ¶ 1.) They did not construct the home; they purchased it from a predecessor in title. (Defs. SMF at ¶¶ 2, 4, and 10.) The Premises were rented to Denson and her family as a short term vacation rental pursuant to an agreement between Defendants and Vacasa Vacation Rental (“Vacasa”). (Defs. SMF at ¶ 6.)

The agreement between Defendants and Vacasa provides:

Nothing in this Agreement changes Owner’s title to, or general rights and obligations of ownership in, the Home. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, Owner is and shall at all times remain fully responsible for all physical, legal, and financial matters pertaining to the Home whether it is rented or not, including responsibility for: the cost of all repairs, maintenance, and replacement of any and all furnishings, fixtures and equipment necessary to maintain the Home in a suitable condition for rental occupancy; financial matters associated with ownership of the Home; and ensuring that the Home is in compliance with applicable law, and regulation, deed restriction, or homeowners’ association bylaw or rule.

(Vacasa Agreement, Doc. 46-4, at Part II.A.3, p. 3.) The Vacasa Agreement is a Vacation Rental Services Agreement, not a lease. (Id. at 1.) The Premises were insured by a policy of insurance that identified the Premises as a secondary residence of Defendants with short term rental only. (Homeowner's Policy, Doc. 46-5 at 2.)

Denson was diagnosed at the hospital with a “large hematoma.” (Doc. 46-6.) She stated to medical staff that she “missed a step,” which is consistent with her allegations in this lawsuit. (Id.) She was subsequently diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury. (Doc. 46-7.)

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

Although it appears to be an issue of first impression in this Circuit and under Georgia law, Denson contends that short term vacation rentals of the type at issue in this matter do not, at least not as a matter of law, create landlord and tenant relationships and, accordingly, O.C.G.A. § 44-7-14's limitation on the potential liability of out-of-possession landlords in premises cases does not apply. At the very least, the Gerteisens were not truly "out-of-possession" as contemplated by that statute.

Moreover, assuming for the sake of argument it did apply, the district court failed to make a determination as to whether the property owners were not actual or constructive notice of what the district court recognizes to be a defect in the Staircase; instead, the district court relies solely on the fact that Denson did not tender an expert in the area of home inspections in determining that the owners did not have a duty to remediate that defect.

ARGUMENT

A. Standard of Review of Grant of Summary Judgment

This Court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo, construing the evidence in favor of the non-moving party and affirming the district court only if the moving party as able to demonstrate that no genuine issue as to any material fact exists for trial. Brooks v. County Commission of Jefferson County, 446 F.3d 1160 (11th Cir. 2006).

B. The Out-of-Possession Landlord Statute Does Not Apply to Vacation Rentals

The decision of the district court depends in large part on the application of O.C.G.A. § 44-7-14, which provides as follows:

Having fully parted with possession and the right of possession, the landlord is not responsible to third persons for damages resulting from the negligence or illegal use of the premises by the tenant; provided, however, the landlord is responsible for damages arising from defective construction or for damages arising from the failure to keep the premises in repair.

This statute dates back to 1895 and is a codification of earlier case law preserving the potential liability of landlords despite the fact that they have delivered possession to their tenants. See Monahan v. National Realty Co., 4 Ga. App. 680, 685-86, 62 S.E. 127, 129-30 (1908). The rule is justified by public policy that generally favors landlord liability and the protection of the public against unsafe housing. Thompson v. Crownover, 259 Ga. 126, 127-28, 381 S.E.2d 283 (1989). However, when a property owner qualifies as a landlord under the statute, the Courts have deferred to the statute and the state legislature in declining to impose a general duty of maintenance.  Cham v. ECI Mgmt. Corp., 311 Ga. 170, 856 S.E.2d 267, 272n4 (2021).

In deciding whether the trial court correctly applied this statute, the threshold issue is whether the Gerteisens were landlords in their relationship with Denson, who was in their property pursuant to a short-term vacation rental arrangement facilitated by a third party. The courts of the various states recently have been grappling with the issue of whether thes internet-enabled, transient rental arrangements qualify as landlord and tenant relationships under statutes like the one quoted above, or whether these arrangements are more akin to an innkeeper and guest relationship. See Matthew Rosenthal, iTenant: How the Law Should Treat Rental Relationships in the Sharing Economy, William & Mary L. Rev. 59:2, 732-770. This is an especially complex problem in states like New York and California, where tenants are afforded significant rights that would severely limit the ability of companies like Airbnb to operate in those jurisdictions. Id. at 749-52. Even in Georgia, however, a "tenant" is afforded significant rights against self-help dispossession. See O.C.G.A. § 44-7-49 et seq.

For example, The Georgia Court of Appeals determined, in the recent case of Efficiency Lodge, Inc. v. Neason, 363 Ga. App. 19 (2022), that the owner of an extended stay motel was required to pursue a dispossessory proceeding and not the summary eviction proceeding available to innkeepers, despite express language in the contract between the parties identifying the relationship as between innkeeper and guest, because the court found under the circumstances of that case that the intent of the parties was to create a relationship of permanent residency rather than guest lodging for travelers, and, in light of that, the language identifying the contract as an innkeeper/guest agreement was simply an attempt to evade the statutory rights of tenants. In so holding, the Georgia Court of Appeals engaged in a complex analysis of both the language of the agreement between the parties and the specific circumstances of the case.

Here, the parties to the short-term vacation rental arrangement at issue plainly did not intend for the relationship to be of a type that would require the property owner or its agent to initiate and pursue dispossessory proceedings to obtain access to the premises. Although the Georgia courts have repeatedly held that no specific duration is necessary to distinguish a tenancy from guest lodging, the innkeeper and guest relationship is nonetheless defined by transience, ie., the provision of lodging for "all travelers, at all times and seasons, who may properly apply...as guests for a brief period," a description that plainly applies to most if not all vacation rental arrangements. See Bonner v. Welborn, 7 Ga. 296, 307 (1849), cited in Neason at 25.

The district court cites Haynes-Garrett v. Dunn, 818 S.E.2d 798, 802 (Va. 2018) to the contrary. This Virginia case appears to be one of the only cases on this issue in any jurisdiction, and it was subsequently distinguished by a Virginia circuit court in Occidental Fire & Cas. Co. v. AREVA Inc., 102 Va. Cir. 34 (2019). As noted in this later case, the Dunn case was a ruling on a motion to strike premised on evidence presented at trial, and it turned on an assessment of that specific evidence; it is not a per se ruling to the effect that short-term vacation rentals are tenancies. The general holding of Dunn is that the issue at hand is controlled by the intent of the parties, ie., it will vary depending on the specific circumstances of each case. Dunn, 296 Va. at 201. Those facts are distinguishable from the facts presented here; in Dunn, for example, the property was not held open to the general public as a place for the accommodation of travelers, that it was rented only to "families," and the owner did not maintain any rights of possession or control. Id. at 201-202.

The district court also would analogize this case to Starks v. USG Real Estate Foundation III, LLC, 361 Ga. App. 406, 411–12, 864 S.E.2d 621, 625 (2021). The Stark case is, however, plainly distinguishable. Stark involved the shooting death of a student of Savannah State University on property leased by a private company to the Board of Regents for operation of student union, for an annual term, pursuant to a lease agreement that expressly gave the tenant (the State of Georgia) exclusive rights to "hold, use, possess, enjoy, and occupy" the entire property for the duration of the lease. The relationship at issue in that case was plainly intended to be a tenancy, and was treated as such by the Georgia Court of Appeal; the difference between that arrangement and the lodging relationship at issue here could not be more plain. The Stark case assumes (correctly) a landlord and tenant relationship and turns, instead, on the question of whether the landlord had truly delivered possession, a related but distinct inquiry not at issue here.

The arrangement at issue in this case was not a landlord and tenant arrangement. Unlike the landlords in the Dunn case, the Gerteisens held their premises open to the general public for short term, transient rental. This arrangement was facilitated by a third party, which also provided routine innkeeper services such as cleaning and maintenance. The district court notes, correctly, that the Gerteisens charged Vacasa with responsibility for providing those services, and their right of entry was limited by a requirement that they notify Vacasa. Order at 15-16. But Vacasa was Defendants' agent in this relationship and, in any event was not the tenant; the fact that Vacasa provided the direct services to guests does not transform this into a tenancy relationship. The purpose of the limitation on entry in Section A.4 of the agreement with Vacasa [Doc 46-4 at p.3), which simply requires notification to Vacasa prior to entry, is to protect the privacy of guests and (not incidentally) protect Vacasa from liability for privacy invasive conduct by property owners. It plainly is not intended to transform a short term vacation rental agreement into a lease.

The agreement with Vacasa limits the Gerteisen's ability to visit the premises by requiring notice to Vacasa, but it does not provide that the tenant has a right to exclude the landowner. See Colquitt v. Rowland, 265 Ga. 905, 906, 463 S.E.2d 491, 492 (noting that in a landlord and tenant relationship "the landlord has no right to enter...except by permission of the tenant."). Moreover, the rights and obligations retained here were not simply a right to inspect and duty to repair, which the district court notes is not inconsistent with landlord status (Order at 13-14), but also a duty to provide for maintenance and insurance against premises liability. See Doc 46-4 Part II.A.3, at p. 3, which provides as follows:

Nothing in this Agreement changes Owner's title to, or general rights and obligations of ownership in, the Home. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, Owner is and shall at all times remain fully responsible for all physical, legal, and financial matters pertaining to the Home whether it is rented or not, including responsibility for: the cost of all repairs, maintenance, and replacement of any and all furnishings, fixtures and equipment necessary to maintain the Home in a suitable condition for rental occupancy; financial matters associated with ownership of the Home; and ensuring that the Home is in compliance with applicable law, and regulation, deed restriction, or homeowners' association bylaw or rule.

See also Doc. 46-5 (Homeowner's Policy). Compare Starks 361 Ga. App. at 408, 864 S.E.2d at 623 (insurance was procured by landlord but tenant was certificate holder and responsible for paying insurance premiums).

The Court should find that the rental arrangement at issue in this case is more like an innkeeper and guest arrangment than a landlord and tenant relationship or, at the very least, that there is a jury issue on the question of whether the parties intended Georgia law respecting tenancies or Georgia law relating to transient lodging to apply. Moreover, even if the law of landlord and tenant should apply to cases like this one, the act of permitting transient occupancy of these furnished premises by vacationers, by a party who retains the obligation to repair and insure those premises, does not constitute a delivery of possession as contemplated by O.C.G.A. § 44-7-14.

C. Georgia Law Does Not Require an Expert to Testify Regarding Pre-Sale Inspection Procedures in Support of a Defective Construction or Duty to Repair Claim against a Purchaser of Defective Residential Property

Assuming for the sale of argument that the parties intended their relationship to be one of landlord and tenant, and that Denson can fairly be characterized as a tenant in possession, both of which Denson denies, a jury issue still exists as to whether the Gerteisens can be held liable for defective construction or failure to repair under O.C.G.A. § 44-7-14, which does not provide for a blanket immunity protecting landlords against all liability in premises cases.

Here, the district court notes that uncontradicted expert testimony shows that the staircase at issue was defective. (Doc. 59, Order at 21.) However, the district court nonetheless found that the Gerteisens had no notice of the defect sufficient to trigger their duty to repair (Doc. 59, rder at 18-19), nor were they on constructive notice of a structural defect sufficient to hold them liable under a defective construction theory (Doc. 59, Order at 19-23).

Denson submits, to the contrary, that the defect here, which the district court recognizes, is sufficiently patent to put an ordinary person on notice of the danger. The staircase (see Doc. 46-2) has treads that diminish to zero width as they turn a corner, a fat railing, and a drastic change in elevation of that railing at the same turn. This defect is distinguishable from the type of latent defects at issue in the cases cited by the trial court. Compare Gainey v. Smacky’s Invs., Inc., 287 Ga. App. 529, 529-30, 652 S.E.2d 167, 169 (2007) (improper design of pull down staircase); WCE Holdings B, LLC, 363 Ga. App. 29, 32, 870 S.E.2d 522, 524 (deck collapse); Rainey v. 1600 Peachtree, L.L.C., 255 Ga. App. 299, 302, 565 S.E.2d 517, 520 (2002) (landing width and tread height); and Pajaro v. S. Ga. Bank, 339 Ga. App. 334, 335, 793 S.E.2d 209, 210 (2016) (staircase collapse).

The decision of the trial court focuses on the fact that Denson's expert, a safety expert, was not able to testify regarding whether the defect at issue here is of a nature that it should have been identified in the routine home inspections that were conducted on the property. In so doing, the court attempts to analogize this case to Rainey, and to other cases where the Georgia courts have held that "[a]n out-of-possession landlord of a property constructed by a predecessor-in-interest may be held liable only for those structural defects that would be discovered during a pre-purchase building inspection." Rainey 255 Ga. App. at 301. The Rainey court does note that the inspector who testified in that case "provide[d] no insight into inspection practices." But that court did not rest its decision on the absence of expert testimony regarding inspections and, instead, made its own independent determination on the question. Id. at 302. Specifically, the court held that, given the property at issue was a multi-building complex occupying six acres with a large number of stairs and landings and, as a consequence, ordinary care would not require measurement of "each step and landing" as part of a building inspection. Id.

No Georgia case that the undersigned has reviewed, and certainly not Rainey, requires expert testimony on the specific issue of building inspection practices as a condition of surviving on summary judgment in out-of-possession landlord cases. While the Rainey court considered the expert's testimony, it came to its own conclusion. And the facts of that case were very different. Notably, not only was the property at issue in Rainey profoundly different, the defect at issue required measurement of individual tread heights to be identified. Here, Denson's expert identified the defect, to the entire satisfaction of the district court, based solely on a photograph. A jury could certainly conclude that this defect should have been identified in a building inspection.

Moreover, also unlike in Rainey, the Gerteisens had retained their duty repair the premises, so there is also the question whether they had sufficient notice of the defect to trigger a duty to repair. Again, this is not a case involving a bolt rotting under a deck or a minor issue of inconsistent tread height; there is an issue with these stairs that should be obvious to a lay person on looking at a photograph.

CONCLUSION

This is a significant case of first impression on the scope of potential tort liability of the owners of premises place on the market for short term vacation rental. The Court should treat persons like Denson as guests, but because that furthers the public policy of protecting business invitees from hazards and because it protects property owners from the potentially problematic consequences of treating these people as tenants.

However, in the event the Court determines that Denson was a tenant, the Court should still allow this matter to go to trial. The district court's decision was improperly premised on the premise or absense of expert testimony in a case where the defect at issue is apparent on the face of the record to a lay person examining the photograph, and expert testimony is not required for the court to determine whether it should have been identified in a building inspection.
