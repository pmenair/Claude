Summary j't that document *was* a forgery: Advanceme, Inc. v. Finley, 275 Ga. App. 415 (Ga. Ct. App. 2005)
Affidavit of forgery substantially justified: Ingram v. JIK Realty Co., 199 Ga. App. 335 (Ga. Ct.

I think we get to a jury on the forgery claim *bc of* Jesse's lack of capacity. I'm going to need a doctor's note re capacity at date of execution.

CONFIDENTIAL SETTLEMENT MEMORANDUM OF DEFENDANT

The Defendant in this action, Cochise MTS, Inc. ("Cochise"), is a federal security contractor providing security, training, and consulting services under government contracts overseas. It was founded by Colonel Jesse L. Johnson (Ret.) ("Johnson"), a highly decorated special operations officer.

The Plaintiff in this action, Kellyjack Luman ("Luman"), retired from the United States Army in 2012 with the rank of Command Sergeant Major and began working for Cochise at that time. He served the company as a chief operations officer. There also was a close personal relationship between the two men.

At some point in 2018, due to a lack of income, Johnson informed the employees of Cochise that he would not be able to pay them timely. This included Luman. About 8 months later, Johnson told Luman that he would no longer be employed by Cochise. At that time, Johnson agreed to pay Luman what was owed him.

It is undisputed that the outstanding salary due to Luman has been paid. The amount in dispute in this civil action is $225,000, a purported severance payment alleged due under a written document attached to the Complaint as Exhibit A. There is also a hand-written addendum to the signature page of this agreement, which is attached to the Complaint as Exhibit B. The Complaint and its associated exhibits is attached to this memorandum as Exhibit 1 hereto.

This case is complicated by the fact that Johnson has suffered a head injury and, as a consequence, significant memory impairment. Luman's version of the story is that the men met in Dahlonega, Georgia, discussed the amount due, and executed duplicate originals of the handwritten document, which he contends was attached to the entire prior "agreement." A copy that does appear to be a duplicate original was recently discovered in Johnson's papers; however, it consists of only the first and the last pages. A copy of this document is attached as Exhibit 2 hereto.

The purported "employment agreement" itself is problematic for a number of reasons. To begin with, it is "signed" with a pdf image of Johnson's signature, an image that Luman had access to in his capacity as operations officer. Moreover, according to Robert Brooks, who ran stateside operations for the company, it was not maintained with the regular employment records of the company, and it is extremely unusual in its terms. Finally, Luman's proposed interpretation of the agreement is that he was due both his unpaid salary and the termination compensation provided for in Section 3.3, regardless of why his employment was terminated, if it was terminated at any time during its terms. However, it seems unlikely that Johnson would have ever intentionally entered into such an agreement.

It seems likely, moreover, that Johnson, in ultimately executing the handwritten portion of the document, believed he was agreeing to pay a total of $225,000, not $385,000, that he entered into that purported agreement while in a state of diminished mental capacity, and that he entered into the purported agreement based on assurances from his chief operating officer, a man upon whom he relied, that this was the amount owed.

The deposition transcripts of Johnson, Luman, and Brooks are attached as Exhibits 3, 4, and 5 respectively.

In negotiations ordered by the Court, as well as prior discussions, Luman has agreed to settle for the full amount of $225,000, conceding matters such as interest. Counsel has informally indicated a willingness to go below that number. Cochise's offer in response was $10,000. Cochise believes that the most it owes Luman is $65,000, but that the "contract" here should be avoided entirely because it is essentially fraudulent and created in an attempt to take advantage of an elderly man of diminishing mental capacity who has placed his trust and confidence in Luman.
