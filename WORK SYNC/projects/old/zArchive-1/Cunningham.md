Cunningham v. Ingles Markets, Inc. et al. 2:20-cv-00131-SCJ J. Steve Jones, Gene Major and James Hardee, Fain Major, James Scarborough, Mabry & McClelland. Hefco case filed and dismissed.

Discovery todo (when responses come in): Need copies of the dealer duties and responsibilities between Grand Rapids and Hefco. There should be a written agreement. Do we have it? Sales rep should have gone over and inspected. All contacts Hefco had on the job.

{supplement discovery AND initial disclosures to add Backer report}




[2021-01-18 Mon] Backer call, need to put Hefco in, we will use the report.

Start with passing, death had nothing to do with his fall, significant history, PE or arrythmia ultimately caused his death, hard to parcel out what the fall did, previous falls, Dr. Kessler's notes show main complaint was shortness of breath, COPD. That's what caused his decline. Can't say fall shortened his life. Preexisting exacerbated, fall decreased quality of life and mental state, but can't say the fall killed him. Anything that makes him more debilitated is going to make it worse, but from a defense perspective this is all pulmonary. Fractures put more of a strain on him, increased oxygen demand which impacted underlying COPD.

Ingles initial disclosures: No other parties. Tables purchased from Hefco in 2012, no other incidents. Hank Postell (co-manager), [Teresa Holcomb, David Waters, and Denise Williams]--[incident reports]; all may be contacted through counsel (see incident statements); Joe Manno [purchased the table in direct consultation with Robert Ingle, deceased]  added in rog responses. They had a cleaning contractor for the floors, but otherwise the area was maintained by employees. Joey Newton (incident report); GRCC inspected the table; Pl gave an oral statement?; don't know who assembled the tables but do know that the tops and bottoms shipped separately. Client has email with Toni Rose re incident. They need to confirm they are not withholding surveillance. Need to view video on Windows machine, but it ain't helping.

GRCC: No other parties. Identifies CFO as only witness. Other officers identified in response to rogs (procurement and VP operations); no complaints re this table, no warnings because no need; 14; 18; they produced standards although not requested.

Leonard Baker - bottom line is, I had this case on the defense side, what happened here is somebody made purchasing decision to buy tops and bases through Hefco, shipment in different pallets, tops and base spread different, 
you can see it clearly that model number EL24S top takes a 22X base, clearly spelled out in price list, these were shipped out and mixed up, somebody with authorization drilled bolts and assembled. Was there an outside third party that did the assembly? Smaller base assembly 22" base on 36" top. Too large table next to it. Contractor hired to receive and install bases? (Boston Market case?)

NB GOOD RECORD REFORM NOTES

Below is a list of people willing to talk to you and potentially testify
in court regarding my late husband, Gordon Cunningham:

- Heather Colbaugh - 470-403-3634
- Michael Colbaugh - 404-444-0229
- Dawn Ferrara - 404-431-5154
- Greg Ferrara - 770-652-5100
- Michael Ferrara - 678-788-3004
- Gregory Ferrara - 678-882-4545
- Scott Cunningham - 904-580-0900
- Greg Cunningham - 954-857-7883
- Harry Tompkins - 914-523-8153
- Rick Grumet - 925-683-5950
- Carol and Bill Hutchinson - 404-281-2281
- Bob and Eileen Schultz - 706-692-1550

None of the above contacts will gain anything from the Lawsuits. All are
over the age of 18. Since my Grandaughter, Sabine Colbaugh, is only six
I assumed you would not want to talk to her.

Gordon was pretty much housebound since his injuries and not up to
company, except for family. That narrowed down the list significantly.
The list is comprised mostly of family (children, grandchildren,
brothers, a cousin and brother-in-law). The last two entries are
friends. His best friend and his wife are unfortunately both now
deceased.

Let me know if you have any question.

heart problems. But...

  and diabetes before the fall, but right before the fall was a great
  time.

ORTHO IS A GOOD PERSON RE DAMAGES PROGNOSIS NOT GOOD FOR LONG TERM
SURVIVAL

AND MAYBE DR. CANNON TO SAY IT WAS BETTER BEFORE THE FALL?

Aimee Garcia -- Guy had a slew of comorbid conditions, I could say that the fracture, delirium post-op, rehab, Achilles wound?, had a history of falls, significant coronary artery disease, etc. Don't feel his death was secondary to the fall. Functional status was impacted by the fall. Didn't see extensive primary care records - get records. Don't think caused death, but made quality of life much worse. Didn't do well with therapy, minimal progress with PT.
