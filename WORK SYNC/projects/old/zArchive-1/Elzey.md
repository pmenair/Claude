2020-05-18 trial BUT ALMOST DEFINITELY NOT--> get nonparty docs,

Offer of settlement $25,000 (per tcw client 2019-05-31) sent 2019-06-06,
per last pretrial charges due day of trial, can we handle issues in
limine in 20 min or less?

OCN was Kristen Medwick Duncan, Law Office of Moore and Associates,
Staff Counsel for Allstate. OCN Natalya Rice per substitution, then
Ralph Bailey.

Discovery done. Liability admitted, "caused or contributed." State Auto
Property and Casualty Insurance Co. (UM) dismissed per Yarborough.
Allstate (Liabilty) has $250,000. We claim $9,856.49 medical specials,
no lost wages (student). About half of specials is chiro and PT. Last
offer was $4,970. Hicks admits liability in deposition, breach of duty
in answer. Expenses paid by BCBS, parent's policy, they assert a lien
but we're unclear if ERISA. Northside record says unrestrained and going
30-35 mph, client says in depo she was wearing her seatbelt. No
fractures, mild straightening at hospital. Hip and foot pain, done
treating.

Demanded $45,000, have authority for $25,000, offer of settlement sent.

Direct re fair, she said she was alright but she wasn't. Had a wrist
splint and an ankle splint. Did not ride the roller coasters. Who
approached who.
