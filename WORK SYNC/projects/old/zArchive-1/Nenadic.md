BRIEF OF APPELLEE

I. Appellee's Statement of Facts

Nenadic, the Appellee herein and plaintiff below, was injured at a party where she was a social guest of a rent-paying tenant of Shoffeitt, the Appellant. (Deposition of Teresa Nenadic, Deposition Volume 2 ["Depo. V2”], at 47, 52-53, 194; Deposition of Joseph Shoffeitt, Deposition Volume 4 [“Depo. V4”], at 21-22, 32.) She fell while crossing a bridge over a creek behind Shoffeitt’s property, which broke under her weight. (Depo. V4-22-23; Depo. V2-91-92.) She had previously crossed the bridge after being warned by Shoffeitt to walk along the structural beams of the bridge instead of the boards, a warning she has testified she did not understand. (Depo. V4-39-40; Depo. V2-62-65.) The bridge was constructed from an industrial-sized pallet that originally appeared sturdy enough to drive an off-road vehicle over; there is conflicting testimony as to whether it looked “weathered” on the date of the incident. (Depo. V4-23, 26, 41-42; Depo. V2-195.) The bridge was available for use of the tenants at Shoffeitt’s property (Depo. V4-25-26), and Shoffeitt discussed making certain improvements to the bridge with his tenant, although these were never done (Depo. V4-31). Nenadic was in a relationship with Shoffeitt at the time of the incident, and the party was being given in celebration of Shoffeitt’s birthday by his tenant, who was also his friend. (Depo. V4-32-33.) Nenadic filed an action for personal injuries against Shoffeitt, his tenant, and the adjoining landowners alleging premises liability, direct negligence in the installation and maintenance of the “bridge,” and negligence by Shoffeitt in attempting to warn Nenadic. (V1-6-9, 124-25.) The trial court denied a motion for summary judgment filed by Shoffeitt, but certified this matter on request for immediate review. This application followed.

II. Appellee's Argument and Citation of Authorities

Appellee notes that Appellant's brief confuses the issues in this matter by enumerating three errors (App. Br. at 7) and then proceeding to argue in five sections that do not strictly correlate with the asserted error (App. Br. at 8-20). In conformance with Court of Appeals Rule 25(c)(1), Appellee will structure her argument in accordance with the enumeration, while attempting also to address the arguments raised in the body of the brief. As this is an interlocutory appeal from the denial of a motion for partial summary judgment, review is de novo, with construal of the evidence, and all reasonable conclusions and inferences drawn from it, in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Matson v. Bayview Loan Servicing, Llc., 339 Ga. App. 890, 890 (2016).

A. Nenadic Was an Invitee at the Time of her Fall

Appellant's first enumeration alleges that the trial court erred in finding that Nenadic was an invitee at the time she fell through a pallet bridge on Appellant's property. However, Georgia law provides that the social guest of a tenant is an invitee in relation to the landlord. See Scully v. Board of Regents of University System of Georgia, 332 Ga. App. 873 (2015) (“A guest of a tenant is an invitee as to the tenant’s landlord.”) (citing Silman v. Associates Bellemeade, 294 Ga. App. 764 (2008); Paul v. Sharpe, 181 Ga. App. 443 (Ga. Ct. App. 1987)). Nenadic’s testimony is that she was visiting Shoffeitt’s home on the day of her injury at the invitation of Shoffeitt’s rent-paying tenant. (Depo. V2-47, 52-53, 194; Depo. V4-21-22, 32.) Construing this evidence in favor of Nenadic, this establishes at the very least a genuine issue of material fact as to whether she was an invitee with respect to Shoffeitt, the landlord.

Shoffeitt attempts by analogy to the Scully case cited above to limit the geographic scope of the area within which the tenancy exception applies. In Scully, this Court declined to extend the scope of the tenancy exception to include the entire University of Georgia Campus in a case involving a dorm-resident student. Here, the question presented is whether a pallet bridge locate behind a rental house is within the geographic scope of the tenancy, and Appellee submits both that this case is plainly distinguishable from Scully and that this question is controlled by Paul v. Sharpe, 181 Ga. App. 443 (1987), a case in which the plaintiff was entitled to invitee status after falling off a bridge over a creek nearby the apartment building where the plaintiff was visiting a tenant. 

Shoffeitt contends that Paul is distinguishable here because “evidence shows” the pallet was "rarely used by anyone." (App. Br. at 13.) However, the evidence in fact shows that the pallet was available for use of the tenants at Shoffeitt’s property (Depo. V4-25-26), and Shoffeitt discussed making certain improvements to the bridge with his tenant, although these were never done (Depo. V4-30-31). 

Shoffeitt also notes that he was in a relationship with Nenadic at the time of the incident, which took place during a party being given in his honor; he insists that that the trial court should somehow have determined as a matter of fact that Nenadic was a social guest of Shoffeitt and not his tenant. However, there is at the very least a disputed issue of fact on this point and, accordingly, summary judgment was properly denied on this issue.

B. Georgia Law Does Not Require Specific Findings of Fact 

Appellant's second enumeration alleges that the trial court erred by purportedly "making no findings as to Nenadic’s and Shoffeitt’s knowledge of any alleged hazard." This argument lacks merit, as a trial court is only required to make specific findings of fact under circumstances that do not apply here. Kuruvila v. Mulcahy, 264 Ga. App. 626, 628 (2003). The present appeal is a de novo appeal of a decision on summary judgment, and review of evidentiary "findings" by the trial court would not be appropriate. Moreover, and in any event, this enumeration appears to have been abandoned by the Appellant. See Court of Appeals Rule 25(c)(2). Appellee will, however, in an abundance of caution, address Appellant's unenumerated argument in his sections 2, 3, and 4.

Argument section 2 of Appellant's brief purports to state the rule regarding a landowner's duty to a licensee. As argued above, Nenadic's position is that she was an invitee. However, assuming for the sake of argument that she was a licensee, Appellant misstates the applicable law regarding that duty. Appellant has repeatedly argued in this matter that the standard applicable in cases involving licensees requires proof of the equivalent of a spring gun or man-trap hazard set by the landowner with the actual intent to harm people on the premises. In so arguing, Appellant has repeatedly ignored and failed to distinguish authority the contrary. 

In Barry v.  Cantrell, 150 Ga. App. 439 (1979), this Court articulated the rule applicable to licensees as follows:

The fundamental concept in this class of cases, as in that of trespassers, is of a liability only for wilful or wanton injury; but it is usually wilful or wanton not to exercise ordinary care to prevent injuring a person who is actually known to be, or reasonably is expected to be, within the range of a dangerous act being done. After the presence of the licensee is known, exactly the same acts of caution may be required of the proprietor, to satisfy the legal duty, as would be necessary if the licensee were invited....The sum of the whole matter is included in the expression frequently enunciated that "duties arise out of circumstances.

Barry, 150 Ga. App. at 440-41.

Here, Shoffeitt knew there was a hazard; he attempted to warn her of it. And his decision to attempt a warning also suggests that, at least from his point of view, the hazard was not necessarily open and obvious.

Despite this, Appellant attempts to argue in his third argument section that there is insufficient evidence that Shoffeitt had superior knowledge of the hazard. This section simply ignores the applicable standard of review in this case, ie., that all questions of fact must be construed in favor of the non-movant. Although there inarguably is record evidence that Shoffeitt believed the pallett could bear Nenadic's weight, it is also inarguably the case that he warned her of the very hazard that caused her fall, ie., the potential for the pallet wood boards to collapse. He was concerned enough that he tested the bridge by walking over it first. It also is inarguably true that he discussed weather proofing the pallet, ie., that he was aware of the possibility that it might deteriorate if exposed to the weather for a substantial period of time. This evidence raises a genuine issue of material fact on the ultimate issue of superior knowledge.

Similarly, there is no legitimate basis for Appellant to argue, in his fourth argument section, that this Court should determine as a matter of law that Nenadic had equal knowledge regarding the hazard. To make that conclusion based on the present record would be to invade the province of a jury. Shoffeitt attempted to warn Nenadic; her testimony is that she did not understand the warning. While it is certainly the case that a jury might decide that Nenadic should have understood his warning, or that she should have been more concerned about the bridge in any event, Respondent submits that these are plainly jury issues.

C. Shoffeitt Was Not Entitled to Summary Judgment on Nenadic’s Active Negligence Claim

Nenadic claims that Shoffeitt was negligent in constructing and maintaining the pallet, and also in the manner in which he warned Nenadic of the danger. As to the first two of these two claims, Respondent concedes that there is a split of authority regarding whether a claim may be maintained for allegedly negligent conduct occurring prior to a plaintiff’s entry into the premises. See generally, Brown  v.  Dickerson, 350 Ga. App. 137, 142 (2019). 

However, the third negligence claim, for negligent warning, relates to conduct occurring while Nenadic was on the premises, and it is plainly an allowable claim for active negligence. Even in cases where what is alleged is a complete failure to warn a plaintiff regarding a static condition, the duty to warn is relieved only where a condition is open and obvious. Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority v. Fife, 220 Ga. App. 298, 300 (1996). Here, the allegation is that Shoffeitt, having undertaken to warn Nenadic, did so in an inadequate manner, while she was on the property and in fact in his presence, without exercising due care to ensure that she understood the hazard. See Byrom v. Douglas Hosp., Inc., 338 Ga. App. 768, 772 (2016) (distinguishing active negligence from premises liability in case involving fall on hospital premises); Rymer v. Polo Golf & Country Club Homeowners Ass’n, Inc., 335 Ga. App. 167, 175 (2015) (“Under well established Georgia law, a person may be held liable for the negligent performance of a voluntary undertaking.”). See also Restatement (Second) of Torts § 323. The situation is, by way of example, analogous to cases holding that landowners who provide security services assume a duty of care in rendering such services. Atlanta Center v. Cox, 178 Ga. App. 184, 185 (1986).

CONCLUSION

Even under the less liberal standard owed to a licensee, genuine issues of material fact remain in this matter for consideration by a jury. The Court should affirm the decision below denying summary judgment to Appellant.

This submission does not exceed the word count limit imposed by Rule 24.
