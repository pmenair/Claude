Dear Tripp,

We sent a pre-suit demand to State Farm in the amount of $392,857.10, which, on review of the file, I believe to be in excess of policy limits. Please convey to your client our demand for settlement of this matter for the policy limits of $400,000, reduced by at-fault coverage and whatever additional funds your client is able to show by way of set off, with a limited release to allow us to continue the litigation against the other defendants. Note that this demand is tendered pursuant to OCGA ยง 33-7-11(j), so please convey this offer of settlement to your client for response within sixty days. I believe that it should be clear by now that my client's claim for damages legitimately exceeds the amount of available automotive coverage and that your client is acting in bad faith by refusing to tender its policy limits.
