PLAINTIFF’S BRIEF IN OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT BY DEFENDANT DOLLAR TREE STORES, INC.

COMES NOW the above plaintiff (“Plaintiff”) and files her Brief in Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment by Defendant Dollar Tree Stores, Inc., showing the following:

This is a trip and fall case arising from an incident in which Plaintiff tripped over a curb and fell onto the sidewalk running in front of the Magic Wok restaurant located in Dahlonega, Georgia. See Plaintiff Statement of Material Facts Showing Genuine Issues Exist for Trial Regarding the Liability of Defendant Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (“Pl.’s SMF”) at ¶ 1. Plaintiff was on the premises at issue in this matter as a customer of Magic Wok II, Inc. ("Magic Wok") (Pl.’s SMF at ¶ 2.) Magic Wok has filed a motion for summary judgment, which is presently pending. Defendant Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. ("Dollar Tree") leases space in the same building, and shares the sidewalk at issue in this matter with Magic Wok. (Pl.’s SMF at ¶ 3.) Dollar Tree has filed its own motion for summary judgment raising arguments similar to those raised by Magic Wok. Incorporating prior briefing by reference, Plaintiff responds to Dollar Tree’s motion as follows:

Dollar Tree is entitled to summary judgment on the present motion if, and only if, the record shows that there is no genuine issue of material fact. O.C.G.A. § 9-11-56(c). Summary judgment is “an extreme remedy.” Watkins v. Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance Co., 113 Ga. App. 801, 802 (1966). It should be granted “only in cases in which undisputable, plain, and palpable facts exist on which reasonable minds could not differ as to the conclusion to be reached.” Indian Trail Village, Inc. v. Smith, 139 Ga. App. 691, 693 (1976). The routine issues of a premises liability case are subject to summary judgment only in cases where evidence is presented to the court that is plain, palpable and undispiuted. Robinson v. Kroger, 268 Ga. 735, 748 (1997). The issues presented by ordinary negligence claims, similarly, are matters peculiarly within the province of juries, and should not in most instance be decided on summary judgment. Mayo v. Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc., 302 Ga. App. 19, 21 (2009). Because summary judgment deprives a litigant of the right to a jury trial, the constitutionality of summary judgment depends on these limitations. Harry v. Glynn County, 269 Ga 503 (1998).

OCGA § 51–3–1 provides that “[w]here an owner or occupier of land, by express or implied invitation, induces or leads others to come upon his premises for any lawful purpose, he is liable in damages to such persons for injuries caused by his failure to exercise ordinary care in keeping the premises and approaches safe.” Id. “Approaches” means “that property directly contiguous, adjacent to, and touching those entryways to premises under the
 control of an owner or occupier of land, through which the owner or occupier, by express or implied invitation, has induced or led others to come upon his premises for any lawful purpose, and through which such owner or occupier could foresee a reasonable invitee would find it necessary or convenient to traverse while entering or exiting in the course of the business for which the invitation was extended.” Motel Properties v. Miller, 263 Ga. 484, 486 (1993).
 
Here, Plaintiff was on the premises as a business invitee of the movant’s co-tenant, and she was injured on an approach to the portion of the property under premises leased by the movant. Plaintiff was not a party to any leasing agreement between the defendant parties to this action and, to the extent that such an agreement might be relevant, it is not in evidence at this time. P’.’s SMF at ¶ 3. Accordingly, at the very least a jury issue exists respecting the scope of Magic Wok II, Inc.’s responsibility in this matter. Movant’s contention that Plaintiff has failed to identify a hazard lacks merit; Plaintiff tripped on the curb of the sidewalk, which was of an improper height and had poor visibility. Pl.’s SMF at ¶ 4.


WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully prays that the motion be denied and that the Court grant such other and further relief as it deems proper and just.

Slip and fall so no UM

Mr. and Mrs. Dixon were in Dahlonega, GA to be with, and assist, their
son who was recovering from surgery. On January 22, 2018, Vivian Dixon
was walking in the vicinity of the Dollar Tree # xxx at Wal-Mart Way in
Dahlonega, Georgia. She was planning to have lunch at a nearby Chinese
restaurant, Dixon tripped and fell, catching herself with her hands but
also striking her face on the curb.

Dollar Tree - SERVED 12/18/19, answered via James Hankins, Goodman
Mcduffy 2020-01-10, no concerning defenses.

Discovery:

Ca Defendants: Identify Vanessa Rhodes Sr VP, Jesse Hunt President SAR
as persons answering rogs but not as a witness. 1MM coverage provided by
the trust through Travelers Property Casualty Company of America. SAR
did annual inspections and until 2018 got monthly reports from a "local
inspector." 2017 and 2018 reports by Jolene Wilson, no reports from
local inspectors. Admit ownership by percentages, SAR management.
Cleaning and maintenance and/or sidewalk repairs by Dartanion Combs,
American Residential & Commercial, LLC. No video. No prior incidents
known to Monash, but Ridino identifies a prior incident involving Janice
Dunn. Will assert obvious defenses. The "property manager was notified
by a tenant" regarding Dixon fall. Allege white paint and red fire lane
markings. Do not contest invitee status "at this time" but unable to
admit or deny in RFA responses. Management agreement produced, creates
agency relationship, generally favorable to SAR. They produced positive
inspections and documentation of a re-paving project they will probably
allege included remarking.

Dollar Tree: Denies invitee status, probably on a theory of no benefit
to DT. Identifies its landlord as responsible for common areas, to
include the sidewalk, tenants rent to the exterior of their outside wall
and the midpoint of common walls. Lease provided. Alisha Boring, Claims
Analyst, responded to interrogatories. David Petrille for Sedgwick
Claims Management, Inc. investigated and spoke with store manager
"Arthur." Policy provided, they have "self-insured retention." Doesn't
point finger at any non-parties. Refuse to respond re prior incidents
because allege no control over where the slip happened. Claim notes
privileged.

Magic Wok: Identifies Owen Gwo and Ming Wang as eyewitnesses. Claim
Plaintiff fell in front of the Dollar Tree. Gwo answered the rogs. 1MM
liability coverage through State Farm. They don't even know who owns the
shopping center but think they are responsible. Cannot admit or deny
invitee status.

Sun Tan: Just a lessee, don't think Dixon was an invitee as to them,
owner was responsible for common areas.

SIGNATURE

Testimony re paint a week after; they will have conflicting testimony,
will probably be able to flesh it out

Prior traversal

Photographs - be sure they have everything

Dental malpractice issue; left temporary in too long; they are maybe
going to try to blame her?

Other falls "especially when it's raining"

Ortho in CA removed cast - do we have records?

Invitee of Magic Wok?

Right to remediate? Look at Todd case at 196.

RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT MAGIC WOK II, INC.'S STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS

Plaintiff responds to Defendant Magic Wok II, Inc.'s Statment of
Material Facts Not in Dispute in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment
as follows:

1. This matter arises out of an incident on January 22, 2018, when
   Plaintiff became injured when she tripped and fell as she was walking
   from the parking lot of the Goldmine Village shopping center and onto
   the sidewalk running along the front of the shopping center .
   (Plaintiff's Complaint). RESPONSE: Admitted.

2. Plaintiff testified that she tripped on the curb as she stepped from
   the parking lot onto the sidewalk somewhere between the front of the
   Dollar Tree and the Sun Tan store. Plaintiff's deposition, 48:4.
   RESPONSE: Admitted.

3. The subject incident did not occur in front of or near the Magic Wok
   but closer to the Sun Tan place, 43:21-22; the plaintiff was headed
   to the trash can just to the left of the entrance of the Dollar Tree.
   35:23-25. RESPONSE: Denied. Plaintiff's testimony speaks for itself
   and does not support the assertion, which in this context amounts to
   a legal conclusion, that the fall was not "near" the Magic Wok
   entrance.

4. Plaintiff's deposition exhibits 2 and 12, attached hereto as exhibits
   "B" and "C," respectively, show the general layout of the shopping
   center and orientation of the Magic Wok, Sun Tan store and the Dollar
   Tree. RESPONSE: Admitted.

6(sic). The plaintiff testified that she would not have fallen had she
walked from the parking lot to the ramp to the Magic Wok because there
would not have been a curb. 84:17. RESPONSE: Denied. Plaintiff's
testimony over objection to the referenced question, which was compound
and called for speculation, speaks for itself and does not support the
assertion, which is in any event not relevant to the issues involved in
the present motion.

7. The area in front of or onto the concrete sidewalk that runs in front
   of the shopping center is defined as "common area. Deposition of
   Jesse Hunt, 30 (b)(6) representative of Defendant SAR Asset
   Management Company, 56:1. A copy of Mr. Hunt's deposition is attached
   as exhibit “D." RESPONSE: Admitted.

8. Common areas are not part of the premises of the Goldmine shopping
   center that are leased to the tenants. Jesse Hunt's deposition,
   56:5-7. RESPONSE: Admitted.

9. Tenants do not have any obligations regarding maintenance, repair,
   inspection or generally keeping safe the common areas of the Goldmine
   shopping center. Jesse Hunt's deposition, 57:14. RESPONSE: Denied as
   to the general legal conclusion; the referenced document speaks for
   itself regarding obligations arising from said contract, but
   Plaintiff denies that the statement is correct as a statement of the
   Georgia law respecting premises liability for reasons argued in
   Plaintiff's brief of argument and authorities filed contemporaneously
   herewith.

Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment, showing the following:

This is a trip and fall case arising from an incident in which Plaintiff
tripped over a curb and fell onto the sidewalk running in front of the

OCGA § 51--3--1 provides that "[w]here an owner or occupier of land, by
express or implied invitation, induces or leads others to come upon his
premises for any lawful purpose, he is liable in damages to such persons
for injuries caused by his failure to exercise ordinary care in keeping
the premises /and approaches/ safe." Id. (emphasis supplied).
"Approaches" means "that property directly contiguous, adjacent to, and
touching those entryways to premises under the control of an owner or
occupier of land, through which the owner or occupier, by express or
implied invitation, has induced or led others to come upon his premises
for any lawful purpose, and through which such owner or occupier could

premises leased by the movant. Plaintiff was not a party to any leasing
agreement between the defendant parties to this action and, to the
extent that such an agreement might be relevant, it is not in evidence
at this time. P'.'s SMF at ¶ 3. Accordingly, at the very least a jury
issue exists respecting the scope of Magic Wok II, Inc.'s responsibility
in this matter. Movant's contention that Plaintiff has failed to
identify a hazard lacks merit; Plaintiff tripped on the curb of the
sidewalk, which was of an improper height and had poor visibility. Pl.'s
SMF at ¶ 4.
