BENCH BRIEF OF THIRD-PARTY DEFENDANT SAMUEL RICHARD ADAMS

COMES NOW Samuel Richard Adams, Third-Party Defendant herein, and files his Bench Brief, showing the following:

Both federal and state law provide for the avoidance of transfers by insolvent debtors. However, as an initial matter, even if a transfer was intentionally fraudulent, it may not be avoided unless the creditor was actually harmed by the transfer. Wallace v. Wallace 189 Ga. 220 (1939) ("[I]n the absence of a threat or purpose on his part to cease the payments, her present effort to attack the fraudulent conveyance is premature."). This relates to the issue of solvency discussed below.

The claimant must also show that she was a creditor at the time of the transfer. Georgia law does permit the Court to consider inchoate or anticipated claims. Here, however, even if, as Plaintiff alleges, she first threatened divorce around the time of the transfer, she did not actually file for divorce until January of 2020, about fifteen months after the transfer in September of 2018. Her standing as a creditor at the time of the transfer is in dispute.

Finally, even if the Court does conclude that Defendant made a transfer that injured the plaintiff with respect to actual claims anticipated at the time of the transfer, the matter would need to be addressed entirely in equity and not through money damages, at least as against the third-party defendant, because a divorce claimant cannot obtain monetary damages against third-party defendants in a divorce action. Shah v. Shah, 270 Ga. 649 (1999). In fact, Plaintiff concedes that she “cannot and did not make a claim for damages against the third party defendant.” See Plaintiff’s Brief in Response to Motion for Summary Judgment at 5.

The remedy sought here is avoidance of a transfer of title. A transfer is voidable pursuant to OCGA § 18-2-74 if the transferor was unable to pay existing or contemplated debts at the time of the transfer and the transfer was made either with actual fraudulent intent or not for equivalent value. In determining whether there was actual intent to defraud creditors, the finder of fact can consider a variety of potential indicators of fraud. 

Here, however, it is undisputed that the transfer was not for equivalent value; it was a gift transfer between siblings. The Court need not necessarily even consider the issue of whether this transfer was fraudulent, because it is undisputed that this was a gift transfer. he real issue here is the solvency of Fulton Herbert Adams to pay his obligations to Mandy Faye Adams, if any. OCGA § 18-2-72. 

Note that the plaintiff also is not claiming and cannot claim an interest in the property itself; she is a plaintiff in divorce and, because the property was acquired by the divorce defendant prior to the marriage itself, her claim as it relates to the property itself only extends to equitable division of the property's appreciation in value during the marriage, if any. Bailey v. Bailey, 250 Ga. 15 (1982); Mallard v. Mallard, 297 Ga. 274, 277 (2015). Moreover, in considering the equities, the Court should consider that the property at issue covers 20 acres and the home subject to potential equitable division here encompasses just one small part of the total land area. 

Third-Party Defendant Samuel Richard Adams submits that the record will show that Fulton Herbert Adams is able to pay his obligations to Mandy Adams in this divorce action without recourse to the family property at issue in her claim against this third-party defendant. The Court should not order avoidance of the transfer of this property to Samuel Richard Adams.
