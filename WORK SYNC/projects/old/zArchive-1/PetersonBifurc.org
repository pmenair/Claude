[ ] Look for stuff about other walmart entities

This action arises from a slip and fall that occurred in December of 2018 at a Walmart in Cumming, Georgia. Plaintiff fell at the front of the store on a slippery, wet area. Plaintiff fell hard enough that she suffered a hip injury requiring surgery, and she anticipates entering evidence at trial to establish that the responding Walmart employee was distracted by the necessity of obtaining medical assistance from Plaintiff and did not examine the floor thoroughly.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 42(b) provides authority for the court to order bifurcation of a case under appropriate circumstances. FRCP 42(b). The Court must balance considerations of convenience, economy, expedition and prejudice based on the facts and circumstances of each individual case. Alexander v. Fulton County, 207 F.3d 1303, 1324-25 (11th Cir. 2000), overruled on other grounds by Manders v. Lee, 338 F.3d 1304, n52 (11th Cir. 2003). It has been held that bifurcation should be the exception, not the rule, and that it should be premised on a finding that substantial benefit will flow from separation of the issues at trial. Svege v. Mercedes-Benz Credit Corp., 329 F. Supp. 2d 283, 284 (D. Conn. 2004).

In support of it contention that bifurcation is routinely permitted, Walmart cites examples of bifurcation involving bad faith claims (Saye v. Provident Life and Accident Insurance Company, 311 Ga. App. 74, 714 S.E.2d 614 (2011), attorney fee claims (Horton v. Dennis, 325 Ga. App. 212, 750 S.E.2d 493 (2013)), and punitive damages claims (see, e.g., Drug Emporium, Inc. v. Peaks, 227 Ga. App. 121, 488 S.E.2d 500 (1997)). It also cites a case where breach of fiduciary duty claims were bifurcated from an issue involving the validity of a prenuptial agreement. Bowen v. Hunter, MacLean, Exley v. Dunn, 241 Ga. App. 204, 525 S.E.2d 744 (1999). None of these cases support the conclusion that damages should be bifurcated from liability issues in this routine slip and fall case.

A typical case in which bifurcation is appropriate might be a case like Davis v. City of Loganville, Ga., Civil Action No. 3:04-cv-68 (CAR), 2006 WL 1312411, at *4 (May 11, 2006), the primary case relied on by Walmart, in which the Middle District granted a defendantâ€™s motion to bifurcate the trial of the complex damages issues presented in an FLSA case, while also attempting to obtain a stipulation from the parties respecting damages.

This plainly is not such a case. Instead, Walmart's entire argument for bifurcation seems to be that it Plaintiff's testimony regarding her injuries is somehow inherently prejudicial. In general, however, a motion to bifurcate should be denied where it is premised solely on "generalized assertions" of a potential for prejudice from the introduction of damages evidence prior to a liability determination.  See, e.g. Dallas v. Goldberg, 143 F. Supp. 2d 312, 315 (S.D.N.Y. 2001). The burden of showing the need for bifurcation rests on the movant. Id. Even in patent cases, where bifurcation is more common, it is granted only in exceptional circumstances, and is not proper simply premised on the assertion that a finding of no liability would shorten trial. Baratta v. Homeland Housewares, LLC, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 125234, *9-*15 (S.D.Fl. October 27, 2008)

Here, the primary witnesses anticipated by Plaintiff, the Plaintiff herself and her husband, will testify regarding both liability and damages. There also is overlap regarding the issues, as Plaintiff will contend that the force of her fall and her injury are relevant to both the mechanics of her fall for liability purposes and the immediate investigation of the incident by WalMart employees, and also because there is evidence in her medical records directly relevant to the question of how she was injured. It would as a practical matter be difficult if not impossible to separate the two phases of this trial, and there is no likely significant gain in efficiency; the actual likelihood, Plaintiff submits, is that bifurcation would add at least a day to trial.

Nor has Walmart set forth any compelling argument for potential prejudice that could not be overcome by standard pattern instructions regarding sympathy and prejudice. This is a typical tort case, and there is no reason to treat it differently or to give Walmart special treatment.
