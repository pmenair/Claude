# Kate McDuffee v. The City of Sandy Springs, URS Corporation, and GA Safe Sidewalks, LLC/, State Court of Fulton County, Civil Action No. 20EV004717,




Regarding photographs, my client produced the photographs in her possession, which are the documents she relies on. I have asked her if she can tell me when they were taken and will supplement to the extent she is able to respond.

Regarding collateral source, we have asserted legitimate objections, which are not waived. However, I will speak with my client regarding potentially supplementing Request 9.



GS Responses to Discovery: Identifies Regina and Todd Fulk, Justin Pritchard of SS Public Works. They are withholding statements, perhaps other alleged work product. They have Auto-Owners coverage. They claim they never inspected the premises until 2019, and at the time of the accident their agreement with Sandy Springs EXCLUDED Abernathy Rd. They identify ownership and control as SS, don't know who inspected or maintained it. They provide a sworn statement and documentary evidence in support of the position in Regina Fulk's affidavit; the produce but do not explain the 2016 K. Looks like they got paid for the remediation in or after June 2020. The invoice is to City of Sandy Springs.

URS Responses: Claims it has no relevant insurance coverage and no idea who was responsible for the sidewalk. Produced a task order for "AECOM"; also produced a bid document / K dated 2011 for "General Government Services." AECOM is URS parent corp? Eventually I really need to review these documents, but let's see what SS says first.

Georgia law imposes certain responsibilities on property owners. In most
cases, the owner or occupier of a property must keep their premises safe
for those who have been invited on to the property.

If an injury occurs due to an unsafe condition on that property--even
federal, state, or local government property--it may be possible to hold
the property owner financially responsible (liable) for the resulting
injuries. Premises Liability in Georgia

Most premises liability lawsuits in Georgia involve a claim of
negligence. To prove negligence, you must be able to demonstrate that:

    The property owner had a duty to keep their property safe.
    The property owner failed in that duty; for example, they knew about (or should have known about) a hazardous condition on their property and didn't correct it.
    The hazardous condition caused the injury.
    The injury caused damages.

Injury lawsuits against the government are often challenging because the
principle of sovereign immunity limits the ability to sue the federal,
state, county or local government for damages, even if a government
employee was negligent. The process for filing claims against the
government and the amount and type of damages available in a case
against the government are often different than when a claim is made
against a company or private individual.

All of this can make it more difficult---though sometimes not
impossible---to successfully sue a government agency, officer, or
employee for injuries that occurred on government property due to the
actions of a government employee. Sovereign Immunity in Georgia Premises
Liability Cases

In Georgia, premises liability lawsuits against the government are often
limited by the principle of sovereign immunity. Sovereign immunity is a
legal principle that holds that a government cannot be sued without its
consent.

The U.S. federal government has waived its immunity in certain
circumstances, as has the state of Georgia. The Georgia legislature has
also passed laws that waive the sovereign immunity of counties, cities,
towns and other government bodies in particular situations.

Depending on whether the injury occurred on federal, state, county or
local government property, different degrees of sovereign immunity may
apply. This can affect whether you can successfully sue the government
for your injuries at all, as well as the process for doing so, and any
potential damages you may receive for your injuries. Injuries That Occur
on State Government Property

State sovereign immunity can only be waived by an act of the Georgia
General Assembly. One way the Georgia government has done so is by
enacting the Georgia Tort Claims Act. Injury Claims Under the Georgia
Tort Claims Act

The Georgia Tort Claims Act creates a limited waiver of state sovereign
immunity (see GA Code § 50-21-23). Under the Georgia Tort Claims Act,
the state of Georgia may be liable for certain negligent acts of its
officers and employees, if the officer or employee was "acting within
the scope of their official duties or employment."

The state of Georgia cannot be sued for an employee's performance (or
non-performance) of discretionary duties. Discretionary duties require a
judgment call or a choice between alternate courses of action. In most
cases, it is not possible to sue the state if government employees were
acting in good faith when performing a discretionary function.

Discretionary functions are different from "ministerial" functions.
Ministerial functions are clearly defined and don't require any
decision-making on the part of the government employee. Thus, whether
the government employee was performing a ministerial or discretionary
function is often a crucial element in lawsuits against the government.

In most cases, the most any individual can recover for a single incident
under the Georgia Tort Claims is $1 million, regardless of the number of
state government entities involved. Punitive damages also cannot be
awarded in injury cases against the government.

Claims against counties, cities, towns, or school districts cannot be
made based on the Georgia Tort Claims Act. Deadlines and Process for
Filing Injury Claims Against the State Government

Before filing a claim against the state, the injured person must first
give the state notice of their claim. Generally, notice of the claim
must be given within 12 months of the injury. The notice must be given
in writing, and there are very specific requirements for who the notice
must be sent to, how the notice is delivered, and what the notice
contains (see GA Code § 50-21-26). Injuries that Occur on County
Government Property

If an injury occurs due to a hazardous condition on county property, the
injured party's options may be limited. In Georgia, it is often
difficult to successfully sue a county government or its employee for
negligence.

As with claims against the state government, claims against county
governments are also subject to specific processes and filing rules. For
example, the county must be notified of potential claims within 12
months of the injury in most cases. Injuries on City Property

Georgia law also permits lawsuits against cities and towns under certain
circumstances, including:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    Cities and towns may be held liable for their employees' "neglect to perform or improper or unskillful performance of their ministerial duties" (ministerial duties are those duties that are straightforward and don't require any sort of judgment call on the part of the government employee). (See GA Code § 36-33-1).
    Cities and towns may also be held liable for injuries that occur due to defects in streets or sidewalks, if the municipality was negligent in its duty to keep its streets and sidewalks safe. Georgia courts have found that street and sidewalk maintenance is a ministerial duty. (See GA Code § 32-4-93).
#+END_EXAMPLE

In addition, council members and city or town officers can be held
personally liable (meaning they can be sued as an individual, rather
than as a government employee) if their oppressive, malicious, or
corrupt actions resulted in certain kinds of damages.

As with actions against the state government, the injured person must
give notice to city or town governments of the intention to file a claim
for damages. In most cases, this notice must be given within six months
of the injury.

PLAINTIFF's RESPONSE TO CITY OF SANDY SPRINGS, GEORGIA'S MOTION TO DISMISS

COMES NOW Plaintiff Kate McDuffee ("Plaintiff") and files her Response to City of Sandy Springs, Georgia's Motion to Dismiss, showing the following:

Defendant City of Sandy Springs' argument for dismissal of this matter is premised on recent case law interpreting the 2014 amendment to the statute providing for ante-litem notice to municipal defendants, OCGA § 36-33-5, and specifically the new language in OCGA § 36-33-35(e), which imposes a requirement that prospective litigants provide a municipality with a description of the injury that includes "the specific amount of monetary damages being sought." These cases, specifically Harrell v. City of Griffin, 346 Ga. App. 635 (2018); Manzanares v. City of Brookhaven, 352 Ga. App. 293 (2019); and Pickens v. City of Waco, 352 Ga. App. 37 (2019), are distinguishable.

In Harrell, the demand was for "[f]ull recovery allowed by Georgia law, including, but not limited to, damages for past and future pain and suffering, past and future medical expenses, and past and future lost wages," with no actual amount stated. Id., 816 S.E.2d at 740. In Manzanares, the ante-litem notice stated "[w]hile our investigation is still ongoing, we believe that the value of this claim may exceed $250,000.00." Id. 834 S.E.2d at 359. In Pickens, the letter stated "we believe that the value of this claim may exceed $300,000.00." Id., 833 S.E.2d at 716.

Here, unlike in any of the cited cases, Plaintiff provided the City of Sandy Springs with a detailed description of Plaintiff's injuries and *the actual dollar amount of special damages incurred to date*, ie., $14,218.56. See Complaint at Ex. 1. In other words, Plaintiff provided the City of Sandy Springs with a specific figure based upon which it might adjust the claim, and, in this context, the subsequently stated figure of $50,000 was plainly intended to indicate a willingness to settle for a reasonable multiple of the special damages as they were at that time.

Plaintiff notes that the only one of these cases that had actually been decided at the time she sent her ante-litem notice was the Harrell case, which involved a notice letter that contained no information whatsoever regarding the amount sought. Moreover, all of these cases left open the possibility that the appeals court might in some future case apply a substantial compliance standard; they simply found that the letters at issue in those cases, which asserted large, round-number purported valuations without any basis, did not contain sufficient information regarding the amount being sought to even substantially comply with the statute. 

Here, Plaintiff provided a specific amount of special damages and a reasonable assessment of the value of the case slightly in excess of three times the amount of specials at that time, indicating a willingness to settle the case within a reasonable and customary range based on a specific amount of current medical expense. Plaintiff concedes that the amount is not expressly identified as an offer. However, the statute does not require any specific formulation; it simply provides that the amount stated "shall constitute an offer of compromise." If The City of Sandy Springs had wanted to settle for that amount pre-suit, it would have had an argument under the statute for enforcement, as well as other case law discussed below. However, the City of Sandy Springs made no effort to compromise this case.

A still more recent case, not cited by the movant, supports the conclusions asserted above. In City of Lafayette v. Chandler, 354 Ga. App. 259, (2020), the Court of Appeals held that an ante-litem notice stating, in essence, that the claimant has incurred "well over" $100,000 in medical expenses and "will seek to recover" $1,000,000, complied with the statutory requirement in OCGA § 36-33-5(e), despite the absence of language expressly stating that the $1,000,000 figure constituted an offer. The Court of Appeals held that $1,000,000 "could constitute an offer of compromise" (Id. at 261) and declined to approve a "hyper-technical construction" (Id. at 262) of the statute, noting that the statute implies that the municipality "may accept [an] amount stated in [an] ante litem notice as a binding settlement." In reaching this decision, the appeals court distinguished the cases relied on by Sandy Springs.

Both Manzanares and Pickens involved Claimants whose ante-litem letters stated that an investigation was ongoing, but that the ultimate claim might exceed a large, round figure. If anything, these cases show that "may exceed" language, for reasons that should be obvious, was in common usage prior to the recent line of cases construing OCGA § 936-33-5(e), which, again, were decided after the letter in this matter was drafted. Crucially, moreover, in both of Manzanares and Pickens the ante litem letter contained only a general description of the type of damages that would be sought in the claim.

Here, on the other hand, the ante litem notice to Sandy Springs contained not just an estimate of the amount of medical specials incurred to date, but an exact figure. In the context of that amount, $14,218.56, the amount of $50,000 was plainly a reasonable, good faith valuation of the case based on knowledge availabe at that time, as opposed to simply a shot in the dark. Morevoer, our letter states our belief not only that the claim might exceed but that it will exceed $50,000; in other words, this was not just a guess but a statement as to the minimum amount we intended to seek at trial. Accordingly, this case is again distinguishable from both Manzanares and Pickens, where the amount stated was simply a vague estimation of what the valuation might be, without support. For this Court to decide that the letter was non-compliant, simply because of the presence of the word "exceed," would be to impose the sort of hyper-technical statutory construction disfavored by Chandler. Moreover, it would be inconsistent with the statute itself, which expressly provides that a claimant is not limited by amounts stated in the claim letter in the event a lawsuit is filed.

In concluding its argument, the City of Sandy Springs suggests that, in the context of settlement negotiations, an oral representation regarding the value of the case would not be acceptable as a settlement offer. However, the Chandler decision suggests that there is no ambiguity here; amounts stated in ante-litem notices constitute an offer subject to binding acceptance. The letter at issue here contained what was an offer of compromise by operation of the statute, and provided more information upon which to assess that claim than the letter at issue in the Chandler case, which is after all the ultimate purpose of the statute. The Court should deny Sandy Spring's motion to dismiss.
