* Samuel Richard Adams as Third Party Defendant in Mandy Faye Adams v. Fulton Herbert Adams, Superior Court of Lumpkin County, 2020000015-JP

Our answer filed 2020-02-20, Discovery dl was 2020-09-01 per court order, did not extend Discovery.

Responses: Identifies the parties, her family members, and D's sister as witnesses. Claims the property was deeded to Fulton Adams' sister, deeded back into Fulton Adams' name as an inducement to get them to invest in materials and labor in a renovation project on the marital residence, then secretly deeded to our client. Alleges drug and alcohol abuse by Fulton Adams. Claims damages equal to her equitable interest in the property or an interest in the property, as well as costs and attorney fees. Not a lot here; per cw SKL, let's just let discovery run and then file a motion in due time.
