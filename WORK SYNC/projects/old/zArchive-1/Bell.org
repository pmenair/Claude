BREACH OF CONTRACT (State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company)

x. State Farm Automobile Insurance Company ("State Farm") is Plaintiff's underinsured/uninsured motorist insurance carrier; it was properly served by its registered agent and answered in its own name, making it a party to this action.

x. Christopher had minimum limits coverage at the time of the accident at issue in this action and is, accordingly, underinsured, as Plaintiff's damages greatly exceed $25,000.

x. State Farm is contractually obligated to provide combined coverage in the amount of $400,000, reduced by Christopher's liability insurance coverage, pursuant to policies 878640811A, 9543401C1811A, 87864061811A, 87864071811B.

x. Plaintiff made a settlement depand

Dear Tripp,

We sent a pre-suit demand to State Farm in the amount of $392,857.10, which, on review of the file, I believe to be in excess of policy limits. Please convey to your client our demand for settlement of this matter for the policy limits of $400,000, reduced by at-fault coverage and whatever additional funds your client is able to show by way of set off, with a limited release to allow us to continue the litigation against the other defendants. Note that this demand is tendered pursuant to OCGA ยง 33-7-11(j), so please convey this offer of settlement to your client for response within sixty days. I believe that it should be clear by now that my client's claim for damages legitimately exceeds the amount of available automotive coverage and that your client is acting in bad faith by refusing to tender its policy limits.
