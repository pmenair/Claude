# David Scantland v. Kelci French, State Court of Forsyth County

RESPONSE TO MOTION TO OPEN DEFAULT

COMES NOW Plaintiff David Scantland and files his Response to Motion to Open Default and Cross-Motion for Entry of Default Judgment, showing the following:

Facts

Defendant Kelci French ("French") was served notoriously by service on her roommate on March 30, 2012. Purportedly, she did not learn that she had been served until May 26, 2021. After learning she had been served, she contacted her insurer, who immediately retained counsel. However, she did not move to open the default until June 24, 2021, nearly a month after she learned that she was in default.

Argument and Citation of Authority

A. Standard of Decision

Any case in which the answer is not timely filed stands automatically in default. OCGA § 9-11-55(a). A case that is in default may be opened by the Court upon a proper showing made under oath stating a meritorious defense and offering to plead instanter and proceed with trial. OCGA § 9-11-55(b). The proper showing must involve providential cause for the late filing, excuseable neglect, or some other "proper case" to open the default. Id.

B. French Has Not Made a Proper Showing Under Oath

Contrary to Mr. Fawcett's sworn statement in his own affidavit, Ms. French's answer filed with this court on June 24, 2021 is not an "affidavit" and is not sworn; it is signed by Mr. Fawcett as her counsel. See Sprewell v. Thomas Hutson, 260 Ga. App. 312, 313 (2003) (defaulting defendant must make factual showing on oath that a meritorious defense exists and may not rely on general and unsworn denials). Perhaps this is the result of oversight. However, even if the Answer presented had been verified, it consists entirely of conclusory assertions of ultimate facts and simple denials and does not provide sufficient detail to establish a meritorious defense. Again, See Sprewell.

C. French Has Not Shown Excuseable Neglect, Providential Cause, or a Proper Case.

Defendant has not shown any of the three possible grounds for opening default. ie., providential cause, excusable neglect, or “a proper case.” To begin with, there is no showing of a providential cause that prevented filing of an answer in this case, such as a weather emergency or similar circumstance outside of counsel’s control. See, e.g., Truck & Trailer Sales Corp. v. East Coast Transp. Co., 141 Ga. App. 85, 86 (1974) (“There is nothing providential in the failures and shortcomings of the postal service.”) See also Georgia Civil Practice § 7.022. Indeed, Defendant concedes as much by not arguing that she meets this standard.

Nor, however, is there a showing of excusable neglect. The case cited by Defendant to the contrary is plainly distinguishable. In Exxon Corp. v. Thomason, 269 Ga. 761 (1998), the Defendant, Exxon Corporation, discovered service documents that had been misfiled and, *the next day*, filed a motion to open the default, including with the motion affidavits contradicting the allegations of the complaint with factual specificity. Opening the default under these circumstances was deemed by the appeals court an appropriate exercise of the trial court's discretion. Here, Defendant apparently learned that she had been served on or around May 26, 2021; she did not file the present motion until June 24, 2021, nearly a month later. Moreover, she has yet to set up a meritorious defense under oath. Instead, she has simply presented the Court with denials over the signature of her attorney.

Finally, although the “proper case” ground gives this Court discretion to open defaults in the interest of justice, that discretion is not unlimited. Stewart v. Turner, 229 Ga. App. 119, 121 (1997). See also Cardinal Robotics, Inc. v. Moody, 287 Ga. 18, 21 (2010) (“While the ‘proper case’ ground under O.C.G.A. § 9-11-55(b) is broader than the others it does not give a trial court the authority to open a default for any reason whatsoever.”) Moreover, and in any event, French has yet to make a proper showing for opening default. See Stewart v. Turner, 229, Ga. App. 119, 121-22 (1997) (finding certification of attorney and conclusory denials insufficient). Accordingly, this Court should not, because it cannot, reach the issue of whether a proper case exists.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully prays that Defendant's Motion to Open Default be denied, and that the Court grant such other and further relief as it deems proper and just.

ORDER

The Court, having considered the submissions of the parties on Defendant Kelci French's Motion to Open Default, 

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that said motion is DENIED, said defendant having not made a proper showing under oath pursuant to OCGA § 9-11-55(b) why her default should be opened in this matter.
