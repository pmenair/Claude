Store manager. Alpharetta. Video from Sedgwick, loss prevention, Moskowitz may have. Regular milk delivery, driver was pulling load, 45 crates each about 40#, 2/3 of the load came off the pallet and landed on the forks of the pallet jack. Stopped him, told him to get it back on the pallet. Undid straps, he took crates off one side and moved to pallet on his side, I did it on my side. Crates fell on my path, tripped him, landed on crate carrying. What happened is it caught the deck plate. Two remaining crates on each side fell off. He was the one who preserved the video and did the accident report. Masks during pandemic, case also obscured his view. Hasn't been able to work, fixed shoulder and tried to reattach bicep. Can't drive.
