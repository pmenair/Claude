COME NOW the above plaintiffs ("Plaintiffs") and file their Brief in Response to Motion to Dismiss, showing the following:

I. Facts

This action arises from the death of an inmate of Johnson State Prison who was hospitalized with a brain tumor and subsequently died of a brain herniation, Matthew Riley ("Riley"). It is currently before this court on remand from the from the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia Defendant The Georgia Department of Corrections ("DOC") has filed two dispositive motions, a motion to dismiss and a motion for summary judgment. Plaintiffs are filing a brief of authorites in opposition to the motion for summary judgment that includes a detailed factual statement and accompanying statement of material facts that Plaintiffs allege not to be in dispute in this action. Those fact statements are incorporated here by reference. Any specific facts relevant to the present motion to dismiss are addressed in detail in the context of the argument below to the extent necessary on the present motion.

Briefly, Plaintiffs claim that DOC delayed Riley's treatment by delaying medical attention at the prison and then, subsequent to his hospitalization, by insisting on his transfer to Atlanta Medical Center instead of a different facility that might have been able to accept him earlier. DOC seeks dismissal of the individual defendants named in the initial complaint in this action on the ground of official immunity under the Georgia State Tort Claims Act and dismissal of claims relating to the decision to transfer Riley from Navicent to Atlanta Medical Center on the basis of sovereign immunity under the discretionary function exception. For reasons argued below, the first contention is moot because those individuals are no longer in the case and the motion should be denied on the second ground.

II. Argument and Citation of Authority

A. Standard of Decision and Procedural Considerations

Defendants contend on this motion to dismiss that they are entitled to (a) dismissal of all remaining claims against individual employees of the Department of Corrections and (b) dismissal of claims relating to the delay in treatment associated with finding Riley a bed at Atlanta Medical Center pursuant to the discretionary function exception. They have filed a separate motion for summary judgment.

Sovereign immunity is a threshold issue of subject matter jurisdiction appropriate for decision by this Court on a motion to dismiss rather than for summary judgment. A court that lacks subject matter jurisdiction cannot enter a merits ruling on summary judgment and, accordingly, the proper mechanism to assert the defense of lack of subject matter jurisdiction is a motion in abatement under OCGA § 9-11-12(b). First Christ Holiness Church, Inc. v. Owens Temple First Christ Holiness Church, Inc., 282 Ga. 883, 885 and n.ll (2008). Submission and consideration of evidence by the court does not convert a motion in abatement to a motion for summary judgment. Deherry v. Johnson, 323 Ga. App. 726, 727 (2013).

On a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the plaintiff has the burden to establish that jurisdiction, at least prima facie. Dep't of Transp. v. Dupree, 256 Ga. App. 668, 671-75 and n.l (2002). The Court is not limited to consideration of the pleadings and is authorized under O.C.G.A. § 9-11-12(d) to hear the issue and resolve disputed questions of fact, so long as the Court avoids reaching the ultimate merits of the dispute between the parties. Id. The Court may alternatively defer the issue to trial and permit the jury to act in an advisory capacity respecting disputed questions relating to jurisdiction, so long as the jurisdictional question is addressed and resolved by the Court, not the jury, before the entry of any judgment. Id. The Court has broad discretion to delay the consideration of jurisdictional issues where, on balance, the Court decides that the fact issues inderlying the jurisdiction analysis are so intertwined with merits issues that postponement until trial is desirable. Id. In many cases, where the merits issues are "factually intertwined" with the question of subject matter jurisdiction, it is in fact the "better practice" to defer the issue of jurisdiction until trial. Id. at 672. If the Court decides to hear the matter before trial, the Court may in its discretion choose to hear the matter on affidavits and depositions or, in the alternative, set the matter for hearing on oral testimony. Sherwood Memorial Park, Inc. v. Bryan, 142 Ga. App. 664, 664 (1977).

B. Sovereign and Official Immunity

The Constitution of the State of Georgia authorizes the waiver of sovereign immunity, and the Georgia General Assembly did so by enacting the State Tort Claims Act.  Ga. Const. Art. I, Sec. II, Para IX(a0; OCGA § 50-21-23 et seq. The general rule is that the State of Georgia may be held liable in tort, subject to certain exceptions and conditions precedent. Among the exceptions is an exception for instances in which injury arises from an exercise of a "discretionary function" by a state employee. OCGA § 50-21-24(2). There also is a general prohibition of individual capacity claims against state employees acting in their scope of employment. OCGA § 50-21-25. Official capacity suits, on the other hand, are functionally suits against the state and implicate sovereign rather than official immunity. Gilbert v. Richardson, 264 Ga. 744, 748-51 (1994).

i. There Are No Claims Remaining as to Which Official Immunity Might Apply

Plaintiffs' Renewal Complaint contains two separate counts, a State Tort Claims Act claim against the Georgia Department of Corrections and a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2021). The federal claims were dismissed by the federal court prior to remand, so the only remaining claim is against DOC. The district court recognized this in its remand order, in which it held: "Accordingly, the Court finds that it is appropriate to remand this action to the state court for further proceedings on Plaintiffs’ Georgia Tort Claims Act negligence claim *against the GDC*." (Remand Order, attached as Exhibit __, at 32.) In short, this Court need not dismiss claims against any defendants individually because to the extend they were named in the pleadings as individuals they have been dismissed already by the federal court. Plaintiffs do not object to amendment of the caption in this matter to reflect that these parties are no longer in the case and for avoidance of confusion.

ii. The Discretionary Function Exception Does Not Bar Plaintiffs's Claim of Negligence Regarding the Transfer to Atlanta Medical Center

O.C.G.A. § 50-21-22(2) provides an exception to the State of Georgia's waiver of its sovereign immunity for claims involving "[t]he exercise or performance of or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a state officer or employee, whether or not the discretion involved is abused." The Georgia Supreme Court has held that this constitutes a significantly narrower exception than existed prior to the promulgation of the statute, because immunity is afforded not to any and all claims related to an exercise of an arguably discretionary judgment but, rather, only to claims of negligence in the implementation of policy judgments based on "economic and social factors."  Brantley v. Department of Human Resources, 271 Ga. 679 (1999) (reversing Brantley v. Department of Human Resources, 235 Ga. App. 863 (1998)). In Brantley, for example, a case in which a foster parent left a child unattended, the Georgia Supreme Court determined that this was not the sort of exercise of "judgment" that the General Assembly intended to shield with immunity. See also Ga. Dep't of Human Res. v. Bulbalia, 303 Ga. App. 659, 694 S.E.2d 115, 2010 Ga. App. LEXIS 286 (2010) (same). 

Because the state has a plain duty to provide emergency medical treatment to persons in custody, and thus policy determinations premised on "social, political, or economic factors" will generally be inappropriate or of only secondary relevance, decisions relating to such treatment are not "discretionary" within the meaning of the State Tort Claims Act. Edwards v. Georgia Dep't of Children & Youth Servs., 271 Ga. 890, ___ (2000). "The purpose of the [discretionary function] exception...is to prevent the courts from substituting their own judgment for the policy decisions of the executive and legislative branches of government," not to immunize the state from liability for any decisionmaking in which economic factors play a role. Id.

Here, the decision to transfer Riley to AMC, regardless of its motivation (which is discussed in more detail in the context of DOC's summary judgment motion) was not, under Edwards, a "policy judgment," because the state simply does not have the discretion to make policy decisions that have the effect of denying or inappropriately delay treatment to an inmate. Moreover, the decision itself is not the sole basis for Plaintiffs' claim of negligence. Plaintiffs also submit that the failure by GDOC staff, acting under Dr. Lewis's supervision but apparently without consulting her further, to investigate alternative possibilities when it became apparent that there would be a delay in obtaining a bed, and then ultimately to leave for the weekend without providing for his care, constituted, in this case, fatal negligence. (See Pl.'s Statement of Material Facts at __.) These were not policy decisions.

CONCLUSION

The only remaining defendant in this action is DOC, and the conduct of its employees and officers in insisting on transfer to Atlanta Medical Center without considering other options were not discretionary acts but were, rather, ministerial acts of ordinary negligence. The motion should be denied, as moot with respect to any individual parties who have already been dismissed from the case and also on its merits.

COME NOW the above plaintiffs ("Plaintiffs") and file their Brief in Response to Motion for Summary Judgment, showing the following:

I. Facts

[insert later based on fact statement, see below]

II. Argument and Citation of Authorities

A. Standard of Decision

Summary judgment is appropriate if, and only if, no genuine issue exists for trial. A party who seeks summary judgment on an ordinary negligence claim has a very heavy burden; it must show that a plaintiff's alleged inability to establish the ordinary elements of breach, duty, causation and damages is "plain, palpable, and undisputable." See Robinson v. Kroger, 268 Ga. 735, 739 (1997) ("The trial court can conclude as a matter of law that the facts do or do not show negligence on the part of the defendant or the plaintiff only where the evidence is plain, palpable and undisputable.") (quoting Ellington v. Tolar Construction, 237 Ga. 235, 237 (1976)). In a negligence case, causation, like breach of duty, is ordinarily a matter for the jury. Robinson, 269 Ga. at 739. While it is true that expert testimony may be necessary to prove proximate causation in a case where determining causation requires specialized medical knowledge, it is not "typically required." Cowart v. Widener, 287 Ga. 622, 622 (2010).

B. Allegations Involving Individual DOC Employees

Defendant DOC organizes its argument with headings relating to certain specific DOC employees Plaintiffs have at various times alleged to have engaged in negligent conduct. However, this is potentially misleading because, as set forth in detail in Plaintiffs' Response to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, no individual employees remain in this case. Instead, what remains of this action is a case alleging that the conduct of the employees and staff of DOC in general, for which DOC is vicariously liable under the State Tort Claims act to the extent that it constituted negligence, contributed to Riley's death in two ways. First, by delaying his treatment by refusing to provide him with medical attention during the two weeks prior to his hospitalization, when he was showing significant signs of a neurological deficit. Second, by delaying his transfer by insisting on a transfer to a facility where it would be cheaper to treat him.

i. The Two Weeks Prior to Hospitalization

Carnes testifed that Warden Caldwell created and oversaw a climate where inmates were disciplined for being complainers. He testified that he requested that Riley be taken to be examined by medical staff a week to ten days prior to Riley's hospitalization but that Riley came back only a short time later and reported to him that he had received a disciplinary report for lying.

Defendant insists that this conversation regarding the disciplinary report, and Carnes' testimony that he actually saw a disciplinary report, are hearsay. However, to begin with, the testimony is not presented for the truth of the matter asserted; whether Riley in fact received discipline is not especially important or relevant to the case. The testimony explains his conduct in returning after only a short period of time, not making further reports of his condition, and not seeking medical assistance despite his condition; the entire incident is crucial to show that Riley sought but did not obtain medical assistance, and to explain why he stopped trying. Wright v. State, 302 Ga. App. 101, 104 (2010) (statements admitted to explain conduct not hearsay). Riley's statements also were contemporaneous with the event and show his state of mind. OCGA § 24-8-803(1)-(3). Finally, Plaintiffs note that Riley is unavailable to testify, no contemporaneous documentary evidence exists, and there is no other source of information on this matter other than the self-serving testimony of Defendant's employees. See OCGA § 24-8-807 (residual exemption).

In any event, the details of that conversation are not necessary to Plaintiffs' case. It is inarguable that Carnes testified that he attempted to get medical assistance for Riley and Riley received none. The facility's own doctor testified that Riley's condition was obviously emergent by the time he did see him, so much so that he assumed the symptoms were of sudden onset. Yet Riley himself made a statement to hospital staff for purpose of obtaining medical care to the effect that he had been suffering significant neurological symptoms for at least two weeks prior to his hospitalization.

Plaintiffs further note that the lack of documentation of this incident is itself troubling. Warden Caldwell, who is responsible for policy at the prison, testified that the only way in which requests for medical assistance is documented is if the inmate himself submits a written form; otherwise they might or might not be logged, and there is no written standard operating procedure. He also testified that staff are required to take medical complaints seriously, that obtaining medical assistance on request is a ministerial and not discretionary function of the corrections officers. But he did not have any procedures in place to ensure the policy was followed, and Carnes testifies that it was not.

ii. Utilization Management

Defendant insists that Plaintiffs' claim as it relates to Dr. Sharon Lewis and her utilization management team is a medical negligence. However, it is simply an ordinary negligence claim, as to which expert testimony is not required on the issue of duty and breach; Dr. Friedman's testimony is relevant only insofar as it is addresses the causation question of whether the delay in treatment occasioned by utilization management's insistence on transfer to a facility with no beds contributed to Riley's death.

A medical malpractice action is distinguished from an ordinary negligence action precisely by the necessity of expert evidence to assist the jury in determining whether a breach of duty occurred; "[n]ot every suit which calls into question the conduct of one who happens to be a medical professional is a `medical malpractice' action." Brown v. Durden, 195 Ga. App. 340, 341 (1990).

Notably, the conduct asserted to be negligent here did not take place directly in the context of medical treatment, and the employees of Defendant were not providing medical servicse. Compare Crisp Regional Nursing , 258 Ga. App. Crisp Reg. Nursing and Rehab. Ctr. v. Johnson, 258 Ga. App. 540 (2002) (failure of nurses to properly assess whether their patient required ambultatory assistance would be an act of professional negligence). The employees at issue here are utilization management personnel and their supervisor. Their job was not to provide medical services but to manage the provision of inmate patient care by others, an essentially administrative, not medical, function. In this sense they were more like the employees of the medical practice in the Carter case cited by the movant, who failed to provide accurate information to a pharmacist, than the doctor in that case who actually wrote the prescription.

Defendant nonetheless contends that Plaintiffs' claim turns on a question of medical judgment because it requires the jury the assess whether Dr. Lewis should have understood the urgency of the situation. Setting aside the question whether specialized medical knowledge is really required to understand the urgency of a request to transfer a patient in need of immediate surgery because he has a baseball sized tumor in his brain, it is clear that this is not a matter in which Dr. Lewis was exercising any medical judgment whatsoever. The decision to transfer was made at Navicent. Dr. Lewis's role was simply to make arrangments for transfer. Her decision regarding where was based on factors that had, by her own admission, nothing to do with Riley's condition.

Finally, and importantly, once that economic decision was made, the utilization management nurse immediately responsible for the case stuck with it, despite her evident understanding that this was an emergent situation, and without notifying her supervisor Dr. Lewis of the delay at AMC. This was a simple failure of judgment, and not medical judgment. It plainly was not the *sole* cause of Riley's death, which Plaintiffs' expert has and will testify was immediately caused by Dr. Smisson's failure to conduct a surgical intervention, an error of medical judgment that was litigated in a separate case. It was, however, a contributing cause, and the extent of the contribution is a matter for the jury.

CONCLUSION

Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment should be denied. This is not a medical malpractice case. That aspect of the case has been litigated in a separate action. This is an ordinary negligence case, in which a jury should be empanelled to determine negligence, apportion fault, and award damages to the extent they deem appropriate.

COME NOW the above Plaintiffs and file their Statement of Material Facts Showing Genuine Issues Exist for Trial:

x. In Octover of 2017, Matthew Riley was an inmate at the Johnson State Prison, a facility of the Georgia Department of Corrections ("DOC"). (Declaration of DeAnn Morris ["Morris Decl."], attached to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment in the federal action as Exhibit D thereto and here as Exhibit __, at ¶ 5-8).

x. In 2017, the policy at Johnson State Prison was that inmates with medical needs were supposed to communicate those needs to their building officer, who would then contact the medical service on their behalf. (Deposition of Warden Caldwell ["Caldwell Depo."], extracts attached as Exhibit __, at 12:05-21.)

x. Those requests were documented only if the inmate made a written request himself by the "sick call" process or if the matter happened to be noted by the corrections officer stationed at the medical service. (Caldwell Depo. at 13:09-15:12.)

x. All requests for medical assistance were supposed to be forwarded to and attended by the medical service as a matter of policy; corrections officers did not have discretion to determine that an inmate was malingering and fail to bring the matter to medical (Caldwell Depo. at 14:02-05; Deposition of Sharon Lewis, MD ["Lewis Depo."], extracts attached as Exhibit __, at 25:04-23.)

x. However, as to informal requests made outside of the sick call procedure, there were no standard operating procedures documenting this ministerial requirement. (Caldwell Depo. at 14:05-15.)

x. Robert Lee Carnes ("Carnes") was an inmate at Johnson State Prison and Riley's friend and "next-door neighbor" at the facility. (Deposition of Robert Lee Carnes ["Carnes Depo."], extracts attached as Exhibit __, at 9:15-10:11.)

x. At some point in the fall of 2017, Riley began experiencing troubling neurological symptoms such as extreme difficulty speaking, radically altered speech, and drooling. (Declaration of Robert Lee Carnes ["Carnes Decl."], attached hereto as Exhibit __, at ¶ 4; Carnes Depo. at 10:24-12:23.)

x. Carnes witnessed Riley having difficulty speaking and communicating, speaking in a strange "accent," and drooling. (Id.)

x. About seven to ten days prior to Riley's ultimate hospitalization, Carnes communicated to a corrections officer that Riley was experiencing significant neurological symptoms and requested that Riley be taken to see the prison medical staff. (Carnes Depo. 12:24-13:24; Carnes Decl. at ¶ 5.)

x. The corrections officer arranged for Riley to be escorted to visit medical staff; however, the supervising officer returned Riley to his cell after only about an hour. (Carnes Depo. 14:09-14:23; Carnes Decl. at ¶ 6.)

x. When the supervising officer returned Riley to his cell, Riley had been given a disciplinary report for lying. (Id.)

x. While he was an inmate, Carnes personally experienced and observed a pattern of ignoring medical needs of inmates at Johnson State Prison, which caused him to fear for his life, including indifference on behalf of the warden and staff responding to medical complaints with discipline. (Carnes Decl. at 7-10, 12.)

x. Carnes believes that the provision of medical services at Johnson State Prison was inadequate, and corrections staff ignoring the medicical needs of inmates was a serious problem, much more so than at other Department of Corrections facilities Carnes is familiar with. (Carnes Decl. at ¶ 8.)

x. This problem was so significant and pervasive that Carnes feared for his own life. (Id.)

x. Carnes is aware of other instances in which an inmate was harmed by failure to provide medical attention, or by inadequate medical attention. (Id.)

x. Based on his observation, Carnes believed that Riley's symptoms were sufficiently serious that he should have received medical attention at least a week prior to his ultimate hospitalization. (Carnes Declaration at 11.)

x. There is no written record of Riley's attempt to obtain medical treatment prior to October 17, 2017, or of the disciplinary action taken against him. (Morris Decl. at ¶ 6.)

x. On October 17, 2017, Riley was finally assessed by the physician at Johnson State Prison, Dr. Kenneth Cowens. (Deposition of Kenneth Cowens, MD ["Cowens Depo.", extracts attached as Exhibit __, at 12:04-13:07.)

x. Dr. Cowens did a neurological examination and based on his findings immediately sent Riley to the hospital by ambulance. (Cowens Depo. at 12:04-13:07.)

x. Dr. Cowen noted that Riley was suffering from expressive aphasia and suspected stroke. (Cowens Depo. at 18:13-20.)

x. Dr. Cowens assessed Riley as an emergent case. (Cowens Depo. at 21:22-22:01.)

x. Dr. Cowens described Riley's symptoms as significant and obvious and in his opinion they would have been an evident cause for concern to any guard or other inmate observing them while they were occuring. (Cowens Depo. at 27:02-18.)

x. However, Dr. Cowens admits it is a possibility from a medical perspective that Riley had been having these symptoms for some time. (Cowens Depo. 27:19-28:04.)

x. The staff at Fairview Park Hospital ordered Riley's transfer to Navicent, where he was accepted as a patient in the neurological intensive care unit under the care of a neurosurgeon. (Affidavit of William Friedman, MD ["Friedman Aff."] at ¶ 9-12.)

x. At Navicent, on his initial intake, Riley stated that he had been experiencing significant neurological symptoms including difficulty with speech, headaches, and double vision for the previous two weeks. (Medical Record Extract, attached as Exhibit __.)

x. Preparations for immediate neurosurgery were begun, but the neurosurgeon at Navicent concluded that brain mapping was indicated and ordered Riley to be transferred to a different facility so that brain mapping could be conducted. (Friedman Aff. at ¶ 15-16.)

x. At this point, the Department of Correction's utilization management team became involved in the transfer process. (Hospital Tracker, attached as Exhibit __; Deposition of Denise Eady, RN ["Eady Depo."], extracts attached as Exhibit __, at 11:12-22, Ex. P-1.)

x. Defendant Sharon Lewis, M.D. ("Dr. Lewis") was, at all times relevant to this action, the Statewide Medical Director of the GDOC and the supervisor of its utilization management program. (Lewis Decl. at ¶ 2; Lewis Depo. at 12:03-20.)

x. Utilization management is review of medical services provided to individuals, with the ultimate goal of managing the provision of those services. (Lewis Depo. at 10:21-10:14.)

x. On October 19, 2017, the staff at Navicent contacted Denise Eady ("Nurse Eady"), a nurse employed by GDOC's utilization management program, and told her that Riley needed to be transferred to a third facility where surgery could be performed with "brain mapping." (Lewis Decl. at ¶ 8).

x. Nurse Eady oversees the treatment of offenders who are transferred from prison into a hospital setting. (Eady Depo. 9:14-10:05.)

x. As part of her duties, she maintains an "offender hospital tracker," which allows her to document the treatment of offenders in hospital. (Eady Depo. 10:09-16.)

x. Part of Nurse Eady's role was to track what was happening in the hospital, authorize treatment, and communciate details of the patient's authorized treatment to a payment processing entity. (Eady Depo. at 15:15-16:25.)

x. On October 20, 2017, Nurse Faircloth contacted Nurse Eady from Navicent Health and requested assistance with transfer to either "Augusta or Emory" so that brain mapping could be conducted. (Hospital Tracker at 2; Lewis Depo. at 27:09-22; Eady Depo. at 17:08-18:20.)

x. Nurse Eady contacted Auburn University and was told that they did not provide brain mapping. (Hospital Tracker at 2; Eady Depo. at 18-18-23.)

x. Upon learning that Augusta did not provide brain mapping services, instead of contacting Emory Hospital, Nurse Eady spoke with Dr. Lewis, who recommended Atlanta Medical Center ("AMC") as an alternative. (Hospital Tracker at 2; Lewis Depo. at 27:09-22; Eady Depo. at 19:02-07.)

x. AMC accepted Riley as a patient but did not have an available bed. (Hospital Tracker at 2; Eady Depo. at 19:14-24.)

x. Dr. Lewis, the Statewide Medical Director for the Georgia Department of Corrections, denies knowing whether there was any difference between how Emory would bill for patient care, as opposed to AMC. (Lewis Depo. at 29:05-09.)

x. Dr. Lewis admits knowing that there "might be" a contract in place between AMC and Augusta University regarding provision of medical care to GDOC inmates. (Lewis Depo. at 29:15-21.)

x. There was a contract with AMC, which provided for medical expenses to be capped at 135% of the medicare allowable rate. (Georgia Correctional Healthcare Service Contract, attached as Exhibit __.)

x. Dr. Lewis denies that the existence of a provider contract bore any role in her decision making regarding Riley. (Lewis Depo. at 31:18-21.)

x. Hospitals communicate with GDOC utilization management nurses about decisions like the transfer of a patient because the GDOC is a guarantor of payment for treatment. (Lewis Depo. at 39:10-40:12.)

x. Dr. Lewis denies that cost control is ever a factor in decision making within the utilization managment process. (Lewis Depo. at 40:13-21.)

x. Dr. Lewis contends that she preferred AMC because AMC had a forensic unit. (Lewis Depo. at 27:23-28:01; Lewis Decl. at ¶ 10.)

x. Nurse Eady also believes that the motivation for prefering AMC to Emory was the presence of a secure forensics unit at AMC, but she suggests that this motivation was ultimately financial, in that treatment of a prisoner in a secure unit would be "many times [more] cost effective," because of reduced staffing needs, contradicting Dr. Lewis' sworn testimony that such considerations never entered into decision making in the utilization managment process. (Eady Depo. at 20:18-25; Lewis Dep. at 40:13-21.)

x. Dr. Lewis is the ultimate authority and decision maker regarding transfer decisions with respect to DOC inmates in the hospital system. (Eady Depo. at 25:04-11.)

x. Between October 19 and October 20, 2017, Nurse Eady made numerous follow-up calls to AMC to inquire about Riley’s transfer and the availability of bed space; however, once the decision was made to transfer the patient to AMC, no inquiry into the possibility of transport to Emory or any other facility was ever made. (Lewis Dec. at ¶ 8; Eady Depo. at 19:25-20:07.)

x. Dr. Lewis was never informed of any delay in the availability of an ICU bed at AMC. (Lewis Depo. at 38:22-25.)

x. Nurse Eady's final entry for Friday, October 20, 2017 was actually made several days later, on October 23, at which point she noted retrospectively that she had been promised a bed "by the end of the day" by AMC on October 20. (Eady Depo. at 21:07-25.)

x. On October 21, 2017, Riley was transferred to AMC, where his condition deteriorated and he died. (Lewis Dec. at ¶ 8).

x. Dr. Lewis' role directs the utilization management team at the Department of Corrections but her role is supervisory and she does not actively manage cases from a utilization management perspective. (Lewis Depo. 12:03-20.)

x. Although Dr. Lewis has a medical degree, her professional experience has primarily been in the field of utilization management rather than provision of medical services. (Lewis Depo. at 8:02-10:16.)

x. With regard to the transfer of hospitalized patients between facilities, the role of utilization management is not to make decisions regarding whether the transfer is medically appropriate and is simply to "help facilitate care with helping to coordinate it, helping to...overcome challenges with transport, trying to find a facility bed, and then documenting the care and the processes that are occurring for an offender." (Lewis Depo. at 40:06-12.)

x. The transfer itself is initiated by the attending physician and the mode of transport is provided for by the hospital where the transfer is intiated. (Lewis Depo. at 37:17-38:17.)

x. William Friedman, M.D. is an expert in neurosurgical medicine who was retained for use as an expert in this matter and in related litigation in the State Court of Bibb County, Georgia, relating to both standard of care and causation. (Friedman Depo. at 6:03-7:10.)

x. Dr. Friedman's OCGA § 9-11-9.1 affidavit from the companion case was produced in discovery in this action prior to Dr. Friedman's deposition. (Friedmand Depo. at 10:07-11.) 

x. The Friedman Affidavit contains a detailed summary of Dr. Friedman's opinions and conclusions, specifically, but without limitation, his opinion that Riley's condition worsened significantly during his stay at Navicent Hospital and that he should have been operated on immediately. (Friedman Aff. at ¶ 27 and throughout.)

x. Dr. Friedman's opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, is that Riley could have survived if he had received immediate treatment at Navicent, instead of being transferred. (Friedman Depo. at 13:03-10, 15:09-16:04.)

x. Dr. Friedman opined that, if Dr. Lewis played any role in delaying Riley's transfer, that would have been a factor in his death. (Friedman Depo. at 17:20-18:01.)

x. More generally, Dr. Friedman testified that "anything that delayed the surgery was a contributing factor" in Riley's death. (Friedman Depo. at 23:09-18, 29:23-31:05)

x. To the extent that the actions of the utilization management team played any role in delaying Riley's treatment, this contributed to his demise. (Friedman Depo. at 17:20-18:02.)

x. With surgery, Riley's condition was survivable, albeit with a significant risk of neurological deficit, even up to the point of transfer. (Friedman Depo. at 20:10-21:07, 25:05-26:09.)

x. Riley's condition would have been very survivable if surgery had been conducted two weeks prior to his admission to Navicent, when he first began developing significant neurological symptoms. (Friedman Depo. at 29:23-31:05.)

x. Riley died of a brain herniation on the morning of Saturday, October 21, 2017. (Friedman Aff. at 25-26.)

1. Matthew Riley was an inmate at Johnson State Prison (“JSP”) during October of 2017.
(Exhibit B, attached hereto, Plaintiffs’ Response to Defendants’ Statement of Undisputed
Material Facts, ¶ 4, in the above referenced Northern District of Georgia civil action.)
RESPONSE: Admitted.

2. Plaintiffs allege that “The Warden and staff at the Prison” breached their duty to Mr.
Riley by refusing to provide him with “needed medical and hospital attention.” (Exhibit
C, First Amended Complaint, ¶s 33-35.)
RESPONSE: Admitted.

3. Hearsay testimony of Robert Carnes, a friend and inmate housed in the cell next to Matt
Riley (Exhibit D, Deposition of Robert Carnes, April 30, 2021, page 10, lines 1-8),
indicates that he told Riley he was going to an officer to get Riley medical help, and
Riley simply said, “Whatever.” (Exhibit D, page 13, lines 3-10.) Carnes then testified
that he then spoke to Officer Reeves:
11· · · · · · · So that's the first time that I went up
12· ·there and told the officer, Ms. Reeve that there was
13· ·a problem, that they needed to get medical down there
14· ·for Matt and, you know, she did so.
Exhibit. D, Deposition of Robert Carnes, April 30, 2021, page 13, lines 11-14.
RESPONSE: Mr. Carnes' testimony speaks for itself.

4. Mr. Carnes said that Riley was taken to Medical by Lieutenant Cumming and returned
about an hour later after being issued a disciplinary report. According to Carnes, Riley
did not say anything, but he allegedly balled up the paper he was holding and threw it on
the floor. Carnes picked up the paper, read it, and saw it was a disciplinary report for
lying. He did not see a signature on the document. (Exhibit D, Carnes’s deposition, page
14, lines 9-25.)
RESPONSE: Mr. Carnes' testimony speaks for itself.

5. Lt. Cumming denied that she ever issued a disciplinary report to an inmate for lying
about a medical request. (Exhibit E, Deposition of Lieutenant Barbara Cumming, April
27, 2021, page 26, lines 16-18.)
RESPONSE: Lt. Cumming's testimony speaks for itself.

6. Warden Caldwell did not have any knowledge of Matthew Riley’s medical treatment at
JSP. (Exhibit B, ¶ 38.)
RESPONSE: Plaintiffs are unable to controvert Warden Caldwell's knowledge or lack thereof.

7. Warden Caldwell did not receive any complaints from Riley regarding his medical
treatment. (Exhibit B, ¶ 39.)
RESPONSE: Plaintiffs are unable to controvert Warden Caldwell's knowledge or lack thereof.

8. Warden Caldwell’s first involvement in this matter was to be notified that Riley was
being transferred out of the facility to an outside medical provider. (Exhibit B, ¶ 40.)
RESPONSE: Plaintiffs are unable to controvert Warden Caldwell's knowledge or lack thereof.

9. Warden Caldwell did not have any involvement in Riley’s transfer and had no
involvement in Riley’s medical care after he was transferred. (Exhibit B, ¶ 41.)
RESPONSE: Admitted.

10. Warden Caldwell testified that he knew of no one at JSP who did not receive medical
attention if he asked for it.
RESPONSE: Plaintiffs are unable to controvert Warden Caldwell's knowledge or lack thereof.

11. Mr. Carnes testified that he is aware of only one other GDC officer, Officer Thompson,
who became aware of Riley’s medical issue the morning of October 17, 2017 – the day
Riley was sent to the hospital.
6 Q. Were there other correctional officers who
7 knew of Matthew Riley's condition?
8 A. You know, the only other officer that I
9 ever really approached about it was the officer that
10 I approached the day that he went to the hospital,
11 which was Officer Thompson.
(Exhibit D, Carnes’s deposition, page 19, lines 6-11.)
RESPONSE: Mr. Carnes' testimony speaks for itself.

12. On October 17, 2017, medical staff was called to Mr. Riley’s dorm by security staff
because Riley had been exhibiting slurred speech and changed behavior. (Exhibit B, ¶ 9.)
RESPONSE: Admitted.

13. Mr. Riley was brought to Medical and assessed. (Exhibit B, ¶ 10.)
RESPONSE: Admitted.

14. Mr. Riley exhibited slurred speech, difficulty reciting his GDC ID and date of birth, and
his pupils were sluggish. The examining doctor was concerned that Mr. Riley had
suffered a stroke. (Exhibit B, ¶s 11 and 12, and Exhibit G, certified GDC medical records
of Matthew Riley, pages 25-26, and Exhibit H, Deposition of Kenneth Cowens, M.D.,
page 15 line 12 through page 18 line 20, and page 21 line 12, through page 22 line 1.)
RESPONSE: Admitted. Plaintiffs note that Dr. Cowen attributed Riley's advanced symptoms to stroke because he assumed neurological symptoms of this type would have been identified sooner unless they were of sudden onset. Riley was in fact suffering from the mass effect of a tumor.

15. After being assessed, Mr. Riley was immediately transported by ambulance to the
emergency department at Fairview Park Hospital. (Exhibit B, ¶ 13.)
RESPONSE: Admitted.

16. At Fairview Park Hospital, a CT brain scan revealed hemorrhaging and a mass in Mr.
Riley’s brain. (Exhibit B, ¶ 14.)
RESPONSE: Admitted.

17. Mr. Riley was transferred to The Medical Center, Navicent Health (“Navicent”) in
Macon, Georgia for a higher level of care. (Exhibit. B, ¶ 15.)
RESPONSE: Admitted.

18. Once at Navicent, Mr. Riley was admitted to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit for
treatment. (Exhibit B, ¶ 16.)
RESPONSE: Admitted.

19. On October 19, 2017, a neurosurgical nurse at Navicent contacted Denise Eady, a nurse
at Utilization Management. (Exhibit B, ¶ 17.)
RESPONSE: Admitted.

20. Utilization Management is a unit at GDC that coordinates medical care for inmates who
are being treated by outside providers. (Exhibit B, ¶ 18.)
RESPONSE: Admitted.

21. On October 19, 2017, the neurosurgical nurse from Navicent told Nurse Eady that Riley
needed to be transported to a facility that had brain mapping capability. (Exhibit B, ¶
19.)
RESPONSE: Admitted.

22. Specifically, the nurse gave the names of two facilities, Augusta University and Emory.
(Exhibit I, Deposition of Denise Eady, RN, page 17, lines 10-12.)
RESPONSE: Admitted.

23. Nurse Eady contacted Augusta University Medical Center. Augusta responded that they
did not have a neurosurgeon able to do the necessary brain mapping. (Exhibit B, ¶ 20.)
RESPONSE: Admitted.

24. Nurse Eady then called Dr. Sharon Lewis (Medical Director for GDC). (Exhibit B, ¶ 21.)
RESPONSE: Admitted.

25. Dr. Lewis advised her to call Atlanta Medical Center (“AMC”). (Exhibit B, ¶ 22.)
RESPONSE: Admitted.

26. Dr. Lewis advised Nurse Eady to call AMC because she believed that AMC would likely
have brain mapping capability and would be able to provide the level of care that Riley
required. Furthermore, Dr. Lewis advised Nurse Eady to call AMC because AMC had a
secure ward unit that is staffed by GDC correctional officers, and she believed that AMC
would be the best candidate for a speedy and efficient transfer in this case. (Exhibit B, ¶s
30, 31.)
RESPONSE: Denied. See Plaintiffs' Statement of Material Facts at ___. 

27. Dr. Lewis did not advise Nurse Eady to call AMC because of any contractual or financial
relationship between AMC and GDC. Dr. Lewis advised Nurse Eady to call AMC based
on Mr. Riley’s medical needs. (Exhibit B, ¶s 32, 33.)
RESPONSE: Denied. See Plaintiffs' Statement of Material Facts at ___. 

28. Plaintiffs admit that they cannot dispute Dr. Lewis’ personal motivation for choosing
AMC for the surgery Riley needed. (Exhibit B, ¶s 30-33.) Neither Dr. Lewis nor Nurse
Eady were incentivized to send Riley to AMC for financial reasons. (Exhibit J,
Deposition of Sharon Lewis, M.D., page 40, lines 13-21; and Exhibit I, page 20, lines 16-
25.)
RESPONSE: Denied. See Plaintiffs' Statement of Material Facts at ___. Note that Nurse Eady specifically testified that the presence of a forensic unit reduced DOC's staffing expenses.

29. Nurse Eady contacted AMC and Mr. Riley was accepted there as a patient. (Exhibit B, ¶
23.)
RESPONSE: Admitted.

30. After the phone call on October 19, 2017, Dr. Lewis did not have any further
involvement in Mr. Riley’s care. (Exhibit B, ¶ 34, Doc 77-2.)
RESPONSE: Admitted.

31. During the transfer process, Dr. Lewis was not informed of any delay in the availability
of an ICU bed at AMC. (Exhibit J, page 38, lines 22-25.)
RESPONSE: Admitted.

32. Between Thursday, October 19, 2017, and Friday, October 20, 2017, Nurse Eady placed
no less than seven follow-up calls to AMC to inquire about Mr. Riley’s transfer and the
availability of bed space. (Exhibit B, ¶ 24.)
RESPONSE: Admitted.

33. A representative at AMC continually informed Nurse Eady that they were working on
making a bed available for Riley. (Exhibit B, ¶ 25.) Riley was transferred to AMC on
October 21, 2017. (Exhibit O, certified Atlanta Medical Center records of Matthew Riley,
pdf pages 129, 379.)
RESPONSE: Admitted.

34. While awaiting the transfer of Mr. Riley from Navicent, Nurse Eady was never notified
that Riley’s condition was deteriorating. (Exhibit I, page 28, lines 2-5.)
RESPONSE: Admitted but not material. Nurse Eady was not a treating provider for Riley. She had the ministerial and administrative task of arranging for the transfer of a patient with a baseball sized tumor in his brain.

35. Mr. Riley was pronounced deceased at AMC at 9:15 a.m. on October 21, 2017. (Exhibit
B, ¶ 27; Exhibit O, pdf page 129.)
RESPONSE: Admitted.

36. Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint has a single paragraph stating the basis of the claim
alleging negligence on the part of Dr. Sharon Lewis, and a single paragraph alleging that
this was a proximate cause of Mr. Riley’s death. (Exhibit B, ¶s 36, 37.)
RESPONSE: Plaintiffs' Complaint speaks for itself and its contents are immaterial on summary judgment.

37. The plaintiffs’ expert, William A. Friedman, M.D., offered no opinion or criticism of Dr.
Lewis’s choice to send Riley to AMC. (Exhibit K, Deposition of William Friedman,
M.D., September 22, 2021, page 18, lines 7-10.)
RESPONSE: Denied. Dr. Friedman opined that, to the extent Dr. Lewis or anyone else played any role in delaying Riley's transfer, that was a factor in his death. (Friedman Depo. at 17:20-18:01.)

38. There is no evidence that Emory would have had an available bed in its ICU more
quickly than AMC had a bed available. A subpoena for records showing available bed space at Emory between October 19 and 21, 2017 was sent to Emory by Defendants. Emory responded that they did not have the requested information regarding available bed space. (Exhibit L, subpoena Emory Hospital requesting records showing bed space available in ICU from October 19-21, 2017. Exhibit M, responsive letter from attorney for Emory stating Emory did not have records regarding ICU bed space during that time.)
RESPONSE: Not controverted and not material.

39. Plaintiffs’ designated expert in neurosurgery, William A. Friedman, M.D., testified in
deposition that the attending neurosurgeon at Navicent, Dr. Hugh Smisson, could have, and should have, performed neurosurgery on Mr. Riley without brain mapping when Mr. Riley’s condition deteriorated. Dr. Friedman further testified that Dr. Smisson’s failure to perform surgery was the proximate cause of Mr. Riley’s death. Dr. Friedman did not opine that Dr. Lewis, or anyone else employed by GDC fell below the standard of care or caused or contributed to the death of Mr. Riley. (Exhibit K, Deposition of William Friedman, M.D., page 15, lines 2-25; page 16, lines 5-13; and page 17, lines 4-9. Paragraph 27 of Exhibit N, Affidavit of William Friedman, M.D., which was attached as Exhibit 1 to Dr. Friedman’s deposition.)
RESPONSE: Denied. Dr. Friedman opined that, to the extent Dr. Lewis or anyone else played any role in delaying Riley's transfer, that was a factor in his death. (Friedman Depo. at 17:20-18:01.)
