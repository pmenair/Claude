# Dxxx Oral Argument 

Good morning, your honor. The court is familiar with the facts of this case. I represent Betty Dxxx, an elderly woman from Alabama, who fell and sustained serious injuries on a staircase at a vacation rental property in Sautee Nacoochee, Georgia. She attributed her fall to the narrow width of the staircase treads. Our expert, Mr. Sxxx, has testified that the staircase violated various codes and standards.

While acknowledging that the stairs appear to constitute a hazardous condition, the Court has previously granted summary judgment to the Defendants, finding them to be out-of-possession landlords without constructive notice of the defect. However, this decision was overturned on appeal by the Eleventh Circuit based on a relevant decision by the Georgia Supreme Court that provides a framework for decision respecting whether two parties are in a landlord tenant relationship. The appellate court remanded the case, and we are here today in the first instance to discuss that determination. However, the parties have submitted briefing that also addresses issues in the case that were not reached by the Court's prior order or the Eleventh Circuit.

I propose to first address the landlord tenant question, which we resubmitted to the Court in the form of a request for partial summary judgment and is also reurged by the defendants. I will then move on to discuss the other bases for summary judgment argued by the defendants, which we believe lack merit regardless of the relationship of the parties.

Under Efficiency Lodge, the question presented is a mixed question of law and fact, and we aren't given much assistance in determining what part is for the jury and what is for the court. Moreover, "Efficiency Lodge" is less a framework than a set of potentailily relevant factors surrounding the question of whether the owner has fully delivered legal "possession." So we're supposed to look at things like whether the occupant has changed locks, moved in furniture, planted gardens, and so forth. However, it is undisputed here that the occupancy here was intended to be transient, and also undisputed that under Georgia law there is no minimum period of time in which a tenancy can arise. So it boils down to the rights to exclude others and the right to remain on the property until dispossessed. 

Defendants primarily point to the privacy provisions of the agreement between the owners and Vacasa as evidence that my client had exclusive use and possession of the property. But as we've repeatedly argued, any guest in a residence has an expectation of privacy; that in itself is not sufficient to establish legal possession in the nature of a tenancy. The referenced provision of the agreement with Vacasa is plainly intended for protection of Vacasa against claims of invasion of guest privacy and not to define the scope of a legal relationship. Moreover, it simply requires the defendants to *notify Vacasa* if they wish to enter the premises during a guest stay. It doesn't exclude them from possession.

The Defendants argue my client was expected to manage and maintain the premises of this vacation rentale, but what their testimony actually shows (Ms. Gxxx Depo. (Doc. 75-3) at 16; see also Mr. Gxxx Depo. (Doc. 75-4) at 19) is that the defendants understood the relationship as an arms length situation where the property was maintained in the sense of cleaning and immediate oversight by Vacasa and they were only required to step in if they were notified by Vacasa of a need for repair. Their actual agreement with Vacasa (Doc. 46-4, at Part II.A.2 and 3, p. 3.) provides that they retain all of the duties and obligations of homeowners, notably with respect to repair. It states "Owner is and shall at all times remain fully responsible for all physical, legal, and financial matters pertaining to the Home whether it is rented or not." This does not sound like a tenancy to me.

Which brings us to dispossession. Defendants last week submitted a copy of what purports to be the rental agreement that might have been presented to my client prior to her stay. We don't actually know that my client ever had any awareness of the existence of this agreement. But they are presenting it to the Court because it contains the word "eviction."

It is notable, however, that the agreement speaks of an "immediate" eviction, something which is not really possible under Georgia law if by eviction you mean something that a landlord does. In fact, if you look at the Efficiency Lodge case itself, you see that Georgia court itself uses the phrase "immediate eviction" to mean exactly what a landlord is not permitted to do in Georgia, ie., evict a tenant without a writ of possession. The first words of the opinion are:

"The three plaintiffs in this case had each rented rooms at an extended-stay motel for some time. They fell behind on their rent and were threatened with immediate eviction. They sued to stop that from happening, claiming that they were in a landlord-tenant relationship with the motel and so could not be evicted without dispossessory proceedings in court."

This is the mirror image of what is going on here. The term eviction is a broad category that can include a variety of scenarios, including self-help eviction or constructive eviction by changing locks, and dispossession is a specific, formal process for evicting someone. It's dispossessory proceedigns, not eviction, that define the landlord and tenant relationship.

It is also worth noting that the agreement contains none of the customary provisions in Georgia residential leases. It also contains a choice of Oregon law, which would be odd in a Georgia lease. There are references to "booking" a "stay," which seems inconsistent with the notion of a tenancy. The agreemeent also makes it clear that my client was *not* responsible for repair or maintenance of the premises, in Section M, where it requires her to notify Vacasa of any issues requiring repair. 

Defendants repeatly state that the agreement "expressly" transfers possession, but this is misleading; what they mean is they believe it creates contractual rights consistent with legal possession. We disagree. And in any event, there is nothing in either agreement similar to the sort of express transfer of possession recited in an ordinary lease agreement.

Now, as the defendants correctly note, there are a variety of provisions in the innkeeper and guest statutes respecting personal property that do not appear to have been contemplated in this arrangment. Hotels have a responsibilities respecting custody of property, and there does not seem to be an expectation in these arrangments that Vacasa will check in bags, provide secure storage for valuables, and so forth. But this is not dispositive that the relationship is a landlord-tenant relationship; as the Eleventh Circuit notes in its remand order, it need not be one or the other. It may be a mere depository for hire under Section 43-21-2, which provides:

Persons entertaining only a few individuals, or simply for the accommodation of travelers, are not innkeepers but are depositories for hire and are bound to ordinary diligence.

Or it could, and this is expresssly contemplated by the Eleventh Circuit in its remand order, simply be a relationship between owner and invitee, where the only applicable standard is that defined by the ordinary premises liability statute. 

In any event, we would argue it was not a landlord tenant relationship, and the premises liability statute applies.

I'll move on from that preliminary issue unless the Court has any questions.

Now, even if this was a landlord tenant relationship, we think the case should go to a jury anyway, and here we have two arguments. First, the Eleventh Circuit did not address the portion of the Court's prior decision that required a specific form of expert testimony to present the question to a jury whether a landlord has constructive knowledge of a defect under OCGA ยง 44-7-14, and we would urge the Court to reconsider that, on the ground that the Georgia cases do not appear to us to impose that requirement and it is a question that, at least in some cases, should be open to determination by a lay jury.  Here, there is a fundamental inconsistency in the fact that they are arguing this was a patent defect, and yet we have had imposed on us a requirement to retain an expert to assist the jury in determining whether the homeowner should have had knowledge of it, of a defect that they allege to have been patent.

Second of all, we *do* have unrebutted expert testimony that this staircase constituted a code violation. There is binding authority on this question in Johnston v. Ross, 264 Ga. App. 252 (2003), where a majority of the Georgia Court of Appeals sitting en banc determined that OCGA 44-7-14 does not constitute a defense if the defect is a code violation, if it a patent defect. 44-7-13.

So we would urge the court to reconsider its prior ruling even if the court concludes that the Gerteisens were landlords.

Next, assuming the Court in consideration of Effiency Lodge determines that this is not a landlord tenant case and ordinary premises liability rules apply, a question remains whether the prior traversal doctrine or assumption of the risk provides a defense.

The authority relating to code violations also applies here, the rationale for which is discussed at length in the very recent case Pennington v. Bridge Senior Living, LLC, No. A23A0883 (Ga. Ct. App. Nov. 3, 2023), where the court of appeals notes that "building code violations...typically present jury questions even as to equal knowledge because the facts supporting these defenses will not be plain or indisputable." That court refers to Johnston for the rationale, which is that a tenant or guest is not charged with the same knowledge of the degree of hazard as the regulatory or governing entity that promulgated the code. In other words, the same as in cases involving landlords, even the fact that a hazard is patent may not relieve a defendant of liability under the prior traversal rule, if it's a code violation, as a matter of public policy.

I would further note that in this case the defendants had a contractual obligation to maintain these premises to code, in addition to their responsibility to the State of Georgia.

Now, I have to concede that the Pennington panel still upheld summary judgment anyway under the plain, palpable, and undisputed standard that applies in all premises cases. It was a case involving a gap in pavement. However, please note that there was a dissenter even in that determination, and one of the other two judges concurred specially to express that hope that the Georgia Supreme Court would clarify this area of the law, and, finally, the majority opinion cites a recent statement by Justice Pinson of the Georgia Supreme Court reminding us that in all but the most plain, palpable, and undisputed cases questions of liability should go to a jury under Georgia law. I would submit that the danger represented by these stairs was not so plain, palpable, and undisputed that Ms. Denson's responsibility to take reasonable care outweighs the Gergeisen's responsiblity to provide a safe rental premise that complies with applicable safety codes.

If the hazard here was patent, then it was also a code violation and, under Johnstone and Pennington, the Prior Traversal rule does not apply. If it was latent, the prior traversal rule does not apply by its own terms.

This is a case that should go to a jury.
