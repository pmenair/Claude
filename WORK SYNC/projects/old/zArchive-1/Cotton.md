Vickie was in continuous pain for many months following her fall. Pain,
nausea, physical therapy and inability to function normally was her
norm. She was emotionally distraught due to the pain and the many
restrictions she endured.

Fast forward to today, the symptoms have lessened. The dull pain is
continuous with severe bursts of pain striking randomly. In talking with
Vickie daily, she does not dwell on her impairment. She does admit when
issues arise.

Vickie is unable to bake extensively as she once did. She is known for
baking wedding and birthday cakes. No longer is she able to do due to
lack of flexibility and strength in her hand and arm. Carrying a purse,
doing household chores, sleeping in comfortable positions, sewing,
writing, typing and hair maintenance are a few of the daily activities
directly hampered as a result of her shoulder injury. The majority of
her daily routine has been altered.

Be assured of my cooperation should further involvement be necessary.

Response to Theories of Recovery

As argued in detail below, although the facts as alleged by Buchanan are
generally admitted for purpose of this motion, genuine issue of material
fact exist for trial respecting the liability of Buchanan in this matter
on Plaintiff's claim of negligence. Plaintiff concedes, however, that no
punitive damages claim remains in this matter, and also concedes that
Plaintiff's claim for premises liability is against the premises owner
only.

Material Fact Showing Genuine Issues for Trial

1. On July 22, 2016, an employee or contractor of Buchanan Enterprises,
   Inc. ("Buchanan") cleaned the carpet at Bojangles Restaurant 949,
   finishing up shortly after 4am. (Affidavit of Peggy Goolsby ["Goolsby
   Aff."], copy attached as Exhibit A hereto, at ¶¶ 2-3; Deposition of
   Jimmy Buchanan ["Buchanan Depo."], extracts attached as Exhibit B
   hereto, at 30-31; see also Buchanan's Statement of Material Facts at
   ¶¶ 8-11.)

2. When the Buchanan employee left, the carpet was still wet. (Goolsby
   Aff. at 3; see also Buchanan's Statement of Material Facts at ¶ 13.)

3. An employee at the restaurant called her supervisor to inform her of
   the issue with the carpet and texted a photograph demonstrating that
   the carpet was so soaked that water showed above her fingers when she
   pressed down on it. (Goolsby Aff. at ¶¶ 3-4; Deposition of Julie
   Brock ["Brock Depo."], extracts attached as Exhibit C hereto, at 16,
   18; see also Buchanan's Statement of Material Facts at ¶ 13, 15.)

4. The employee who sent the photograph was concerned enough that she
   asked whether the store should be opened; the supervisor instructed
   her to open the store, and the store opened at 5am. (Goolsby Aff. at
   ¶¶ 4-5.)

5. The supervisor contacted Buchanan regarding the condition of the
   carpet, but no one came to address the issue until after Plaintiff's
   fall. (Goolsby Aff. at ¶¶ 6-7, 9; Brock Depo. at 16-17; see also
   Buchanan's Statement of Material Facts at ¶ 19, 22.)

6. Plaintiff does not recall seeing any wet floor cones; if there were
   cones, they were placed on the dry tile, not on the wet carpet.
   (Deposition of Vickie Cotton at 36; Brock Depo. at 20-21.) Plaintiff
   fell at around 9am. (Buchanan Depo. at 33.)

7. After Plaintiff fell, a picture was taken of where she fell, which
   was on a tiled area near the wet carpet. (Goolsby Aff. at ¶ 8; Brock
   Depo. at 14-15, 41, and Exhibit P-11 thereto.)

Facts

This is a slip and fall case. Plaintiff slipped and fell at a Bojangles'
restaurant after walking across a wet carpet onto a tiled area.
Plaintiff has sued both Bojangles' ("BJR"), the property owner, and the
carpet cleaner who left the carpet wet. Buchanan, the carpet cleaner
responsible for the carpet being wet, admits that it cleaned the carpet
that day but nevertheless seeks summary judgment in this matter. As
argued below, the Court should deny the motion.

Argument and Citation of Authorities

I. Standard of Decision

Summary judgment, which substitutes for trial, is appropriate if, but
only if, "the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and
admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that
there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving
party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." OCGA § 9-11-56.
Issues of negligence and proximate cause have always been considered in
Georgia to be "peculiarly within the exclusive province of the jury."
Yeager v. Jacobs 111 Ga. App. 358, 358 (1965).

2. Premises Liability

Plaintiff concedes that Buchanan was neither the owner nor the occupier
of the premises at issue in this case at the time of her fall and that
she does not have a claim under OCGA 51-3-1 against Buchanan. Indeed,
she has not pled such a claim.

3. Negligence and the Acceptance Doctrine

In seeking summary judgment on Plaintiff's negligence claim, Buchanan
begins by noting the lack of contractual privity between Plaintiff and
Buchanan. However, where a duty arises outside of a contract, neither
direct privity nor third-party beneficiary status is required to bring
suit. This is a long-standing principle of Georgia law articulated in
many cases, including those cases cited by Buchanan. Among the
annotation cases to OCGA § 51-1-11, perhaps the most instructive is Sims
v. Am. Casualty Co., 131 Ga. App. 461 (1974), in which the Georgia Court
of Appeals recognized a common law right of action for negligent
performance of safety inspections of premises regardless of privity.
That court held:

"It is axiomatic that a single act or course of conduct may constitute
not only a breach of contract but an independent tort as well, if in
addition to violating a contract obligation it also violates a duty owed
to plaintiff independent of contract to avoid harming him."

Id. at 480.

As the Sims court notes, the extension of the common law duty of care in
tort to parties without privity of contract has been established law in
Georgia at least since 1968, when the relevant statute was amended to
allow direct product liability actions against a manufacturer even
without privity. Tort duties are "inherent in human society." Newill v.
Atlanta Gas Light, 48 Ga. App. 226, 228 (1933). The principle limitation
on the scope of tort duties is not contractual privity but
forseeability. See, e.g., Thomas v. Williams, 105 Ga. App. 321 326 ("The
most common test of negligence is whether the consequences of the
alleged wrongful act are reasonably to be foreseen as injurious to
others coming within the range of such acts."). See also Restatement 2d
of Torts § 281 (citing Palsgraf v. Long Island R. Co. 248 N.Y. 339
(1928) as the basis for its discussion of what constitutes the "class of
persons" with respect to which tort duties are owed).

The Sims court also cited as authoritative and impliedly adopts
Restatement 2d Torts § 324A, which provides:

"One who undertakes, gratuitously or for consideration, to render
services to another which he should recognize as necessary for the
protection of a third person or his things, is subject to liability to
the third person for physical harm resulting from his failure to
exercise reasonable care to [perform] his undertaking, if...his failure
to exercise reasonable care increases the risk of such harm."

Sims at 474. See also Brown v. All-Tech Inv. Group, Inc., 265 Ga. App.
889, 898 (2004) (recognizing Restatement Torts § 324A as having been
formally adopted by the Georgia Supreme Court in Huggins v. Aetna Cas.
&c. Co., 245 Ga. 248, 249 (1980) and frequently applied since).

Indeed, the very case cited by Buchanan as authoritative /recognizes
this fundamental principle of tort law/. Davidson v. Meticulously Clean
Sweeper, LLC., 329 Ga. App. 640, 644-45 (2014). The relevant holding of
the Davidson case is its holding that the plaintiffs in that case /also/
failed to provide evidence sufficient to raise a jury issue on the
question whether the service at issue in that case, de-icing, had been
negligently performed; the de-icing occurred the night before, during
continuously icy weather, and there was no evidence that the de-icing
was performed improperly or was the cause of the condition that caused
that plaintiff to slip and fall.

The Davidson case is plainly distinguishable, in that the evidence here
suggests that Buchanan's employee left the carpets at BJR's premises
entirely soaked, so much so that water pooled above a BJR employee's
fingers when she pressed down on the carpet. Plaintiff fell after
crossing the carpet, while it was still wet, onto a tile surface. Under
these circumstances, Buchanan simply cannot argue that no evidence
supports Plaintiff's claim of negligence against it. In fact, Buchanan
appears to conced as much in its brief at 13-14, and in its citation to
Kelley v. Piggly Wiggly Southern, Inc., 230 Ga. App. 508 (1997).

Buchanan nonetheless contends that it should be relieved of liability
due to the "acceptance doctrine," pursuant to which a contractor is
relieved of liability to third parties after its work is inspected and
accepted by a premises owner. The cases cited in support of this
principle are mostly building contracting cases where what is alleged is
defective construction. See, e.g., Thomaston Acquisition, LLC v.
Piedmont Construction Group, Inc, 306 Ga. 102 (2019), a recent case
which includes a substantial discussion of the origins and scope of the
doctrine. J.M.S. Building Maintenance, Inc. v. Adcox, 301 Ga. App. 798,
801 (2009), the only janitorial case cited by Buchanan, is a case in
which the Court of Appeals found that issues of material fact existed
where it was alleged that an independent contractor created an ice
hazard by improperly disposing of mop water and mentioned, in dicta,
that the case was distinguishable from cases where "the contractor
properly executed the directions of the owner or a primary contractor
and the work was accepted." Id. It is not clear authority for the
proposition that the acceptance doctrine is ever applicable in
janitorial cases.

Moreover, even assuming arguendo that the acceptance doctrine might
apply to a case such as this one, there is, at the very least, a genuine
issue of material fact as to whether the work of Buchanan's employee was
ever "accepted" by BJR, whose manager has testified that she instructed
her store employees to put up cones and immediately called Mr. Buchanan
to demand that he remediate the hazard. The fact that BJR's own
negligence in opening the store for customers may have been an
"intervening cause" is a question that should be and, indeed, must be
submitted to the jury. See, e.g., Brandvain v. Ridgeview Institute,
Inc., 188 Ga. App. 106, 116 (1988) (even criminal intervening acts, if
reasonably forseeable, do not break the chain of legal causation). The
Court of Appeals has held:

"The most generally accepted theory of causation is that of natural and
probable consequences; and in order to hold the defendant liable, the
evidence must show either that the act of the defendant complained of
was the sole occasion of the injury, or that it put in operation other
causal forces, such as were the direct, natural, and probable
consequences of the original act, or that the intervening agency could
have reasonably been anticipated or foreseen by the original
wrongdoer....[Q]uestions of negligence and proximate cause are
ordinarily reserved for the jury." Southern Intermodal Logistics,
Inc. v. Coleman, 175 Ga. App. 853, 853-54 (1985) (citations and
quotation marks omitted). Here, genuine issues of material fact as to
comparative fault exist in this case that must be decided by a jury.

4. Punitive Damages

Plaintiff has not asserted a punitive damages claim against Buchanan and
would withdraw it herein if she had.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully prays that Buchanan's motion for
partial summary judgment be denied, that the matter be set for trial,
and that the Court grant such other and further relief as it deems
proper and just.
