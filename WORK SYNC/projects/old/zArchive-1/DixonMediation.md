Lefkow - We'll try to get into a better position, hiccup with the medical bills but we'll keep working. MSJ, liability very much disputed. Prior traversal going to Dollar Tree. Condition open and obvious static condition. Clear color differential, fire lane painted. Google Earth shows it was painted the day of the fall, stripe was there. No other instances, lots of folks have negotiated without trouble. But anything could happen. Causation on injuries, no real issues but some of the dental treeatment, Deborah thinks treatment might not be fully related (left temporary in longer than should have during move, caused infection, some treatment was cosmetic (they were already in her mouth) - they are not disputing the two fractures).

425,000

Curb height varies. Was probably paved between prior traversal and date of fall. Never appreciated that the curb was there. 

Per client, Dr. Baldwin tooth being broken at the root caused the infection, teeth next to it were dying. Emergency have to take care of it. Thought dentist in Houston was better qualified.

--> DW 20,000 They feel strong re liability, they are confident re the red paint, main issue is the dental expense, 25-26 of the billing was for work never actually performed. Number in the low thirties was for unrelated treatment, teeth 9 and 10 were fractured in the fall, they'll buy 11, their total eval of the medical bills is 13.5 related. Take a step back and be sure we're on the same page. So majority is unrelated or not accomplished yet.

BIG MIXUP RE THE NUMBERS
