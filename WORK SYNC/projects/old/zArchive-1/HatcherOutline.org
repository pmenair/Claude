This is the deposition of a Corporate Representative of Progressive Mountain Insurance Company, taken pursuant to notice and agreement of counsel under the Georgia Civil Practice Act.  We are taking this deposition by videoconference, with the understanding that the witness will be under oath despite the Court Reporter being in a different physical location than the witness.  We also will be reserving objections except to the form of the question and responsiveness of the answer, if that is agreeable to counsel. 

Could you please swear the witness.

Good morning.  My name is Paul Menair, I'm an attorney with Steven Leibel PC and I represent Mr. Hatcher in a lawsuit against you.

Have you ever given sworn testimony before?

I am going to ask you a series of questions.  You are under oath.  The court reporter will be trying to make a written transcript of what we say here today, and it helps her if we try not to talk over each other, okay?

Please let me know if I interrupt you before you're finished, or if you don't understand a question.

I am happy to take a break at any time you like, but if there's a question on the table I will ask you to answer it before you leave the room, fair enough?

Finally, you have been designated to testify on behalf of the company, Progressive Mountain Insurance Company.  I will be asking you some personal questions at the beginning, but for the most part I want you to wear the corporate representative hat today.  Do you understand the distinction?

If it's ever unclear, please let me know.

Can you state your full name for the record.

Have you ever gone by any other names?

Are you employed by Progressive Mountain Insurance Company?  Is it okay if I just say "Progressive"?

What is your current title?

What is your actual job?  Who do you report to?

I don't want to know anything about any conversations or email between you and any lawyers for Progressive, but I do want to know if you did anything to prepare for this deposition.  Did you meet with anyone?

Who was at that meeting?

Did you review any documents?

I'm showing you what we will mark as Exhibit 1.

Are you familiar with this document?

Are you the person designated by Progressive to testify on its behalf today?

On page 2, there is a list of topics.

Are you generally prepared to testify regarding these topics?

On the topic of Progressive's answer, there are some defenses that involve legal questions, and I understand that you are not a lawyer.

On the fact question of whether the vehicle driven By Alexis Antonio Susana on April 28, 2020, was insured by Progressive, on the day of the collision with my client, the company admits that, correct?

And that policy was registered with the United States Department of Transportation on Mr. Susana's DOT number, which I don't expect you to know off the top of your head, yes?

And Progressive also admits it is properly joined in this matter as a direct action defendant, with some concerns about venue we'll talk about in a moment.

So if Mr. Susana is liable in this matter, and I understand you might say that's a big if, Progressive would be liable under the direct action statute. Your understanding. Are you able to say on behalf of the company.

Are you aware of any factual defenses to direct action liability in this case that would not be available to Mr. Susana, like a coverage defense or facts suggesting that the direct action statute might not apply?

On the venue issue, again, you're not a lawyer, but do you have some understanding of what that's about?

I'm showing you what we'll mark as Exhibit 2

Ever seen this?

We'll get back to it. Let's mark another exhibit, 3

Are you familiar with this document?

I'll represent that this appears to be Progressive's responses to our interrogatories, and the reason I had to mark #2 is whoever prepared this did not copy the questions over into their responses, so we will have to look back and forth. But luckily there is not a lot to go through.

First, these appear to be signed by Mr. McKimm, that is not your signature, correct?

And I do not believe we ever received a verification of these responses.  Do you know whether anyone at Progressive signed a piece of paper saying these responses are accurate?

Did you review these responses to prepare for today?

Are you prepare to testify about these responses on behalf of Progressive?

Number 1 asks about underwriting policies. Please take a second to read it. It's going to be attached to the deposition, so you don't need to read it out loud.

Let's look at the response.

Is it your sworn testimony today on behalf of Progressive that Progressive has no information responsive to a general question asking it to describe its underwriting policies?  If not, what would you say sitting here today in response to that question?

How does Progressive go about determining whether a potential insured qualifies for coverage? Walk me through that process in as much detail as you can.

I'll come back to that in a second. Let's look at the second interrogatory, in Exhibit 2.  And the response.

Regarding Interrogatory 2, is it Progressive's testimony today that it has no information responsive to a question about its continuing requirements for an insured to maintain coverage?  If not, what would you say sitting here today in response to that question?

I'll represent, if you don't know, that Mr. Susana was a one man operation with a single driver. Walk me through what he would have had to do, on a policy basis, assuming those policies were followed, to maintain his coverage?

Does Progressive conduct audits or inspections?  Were any conducted in Mr. Susana's case?

What does Progressive do to make sure its insureds employ qualified drivers?  MVRs?  Medical cards?

Question 3 is about MVRs.

Answer is no responsive information again.  Again, is that still Progressive's testimony?

Are insured required to maintain any particular documents, and what does Progressive do to make sure that happens?

Is Progressive involved in any way in hiring of drivers?  If Mr. Susana were to have hired a driver while he was insured by Progressive, would Progressive have required him to get any sort of permission or confirmation?

Please look at interrogatory 4, and the answer.

Is that accurate?  Will Progressive provide a verified response?

Are you familiar with what's in Mr. Susana's file, by which I really mean any documents maintained by Progressive relating to Mr. Susana's coverage, underwriting, so forth?

How about the claim file relating to this case?

Look at Request 10.

Does Progressive have any MVRs for Mr. Susana? Can I have them?

Any other driving or safety records relating to him or his company?

Audits, logs, medical qualification records, anything else?

I also asked about the claim file, and I'll represent that your attorney objected to producing that. Without telling me anything about the contents of any documents in the claim file, are you familiar with those documents?

Could you tell me what type of documents are in the file, again without telling me what they actually say?

Progressive did investigate this claim, yes?

I'll represent that in its answer, Progressive takes the position that it lacks information sufficient to form a belief as to whether Mr. Susana was at fault in causing the accident, is that consistent with your understanding?

I'm going to show you some video, we'll mark this ___

Have you seen this video?

Were you aware there was dashcam footage of this incident?

Do you know whether Progressive had a copy of this video prior to the lawsuit being filed?

I'm going to play it once at ordinary speed.

Can you describe to me what you see in the video?

Okay, I'm going to back up to the two second mark and go through it more slowly. 

Does it look to you like Mr. Susana was sitting in the road, or he backed out into the road?

If Mr. Susana's testimony was that he was parked and not moving and had been for some time before the collision, do you think that testimony is consistent with the video?

Is there anything you can think of that my client could of or should have done to avoid the collision?

Sitting here today, on behalf of Progressive, does Progressive lack knowledge sufficient to form a belief as to whether Mr. Susana was at fault in this accident?

Is there anything relevant to this case that you're aware of that we haven't talked about?

Mr. Susana is no longer insured by Progressive, is that correct?

Was that his decision or Progressive's?



Thank you.
