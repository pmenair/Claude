60 Applicants

High cost application

17 other companies gave presentations, lots of lobbyists and attorneys

Big companies, thousands of employees, but GSB was best positioned, only one who could have gone to market in 6 months, requirement was one year.

Winners mostly probably can't meet the one year requirement.

Support from mayor, chief of police, etc.

Female builder, board made up of black, female, veterans.

Phone call from chairman to our chairman, black doctor, call said GSB was clearly in the lead.

Meeting was in Columbus

"This is going to a Georgia company, not going to be like the rest of the states, not the three Cs (Canada, Colorado, California)"

"Going to be a minority company, and when I say minority I mean blacks"

This was on video, taken down after editing to remove. Editing obvious because there's a clock in the video.

[ ] spoliation

Protest from a Florida company, 60 day delay. Form a Georgia company, delay of process, but they get one of the licenses.

Series of questions, "judging sheets"

Lawsuits already pending, protests.

2 class 1, 4 class 2, we scored *way* down.

After announcement, "tell Reggie, you're going to get a license" - less than two weeks to file a protest. Would have been impossible, maybe, but we didn't protest.

Lawsuit to recover entry fees?

Class 1 = $100,000
Class 2 =  $50,000

"Every company that got a license was at least 45% black owned."

We're 21.3% black owned

Florida company gave 1MM to Morehouse, publicly traded company. Chairman was a Morehouse graduate.

Where is the money going?

Donation to the governor. Maximum.

Chairman out to dinner with one of the companies.

Tom Price breaks quiet period.

Expense accounts.

Paid to be on the commission? Just expenses.

Subjective questions, most states it's outside professionals, these people had no clue about practicalities.
