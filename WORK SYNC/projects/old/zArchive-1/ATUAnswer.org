RESPONSE TO COMPLAINT TO VACATE AND CROSS-MOTION FOR CONFIRMATION

COMES NOW Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 732 ("ATU" or "Defendant") and responds to the Memorandum in Support of Complaint to Vacate Arbitration Award filed in the above matter by Movant Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) ("MARTA" or "Plaintiff"), showing the following:

Facts

The parties conducted a grievance arbitration on July 28, 2022 and November 21, 2022. (Opinion and Award, attached as Exhibit A, at 1.) The arbitrator, Amy Sergent, entered her award on January 11, 2023 (the "Award").

In her Award, the arbitrator found that the parties were subject to a collective bargaining agreement providing for a grievance procedure culminating in binding arbitration. (Award at 3.) The grievance at issue arises from the termination of Ayodele Adenrele ("Adenrele") on January 13, 2021, allegedly for sexual harassment of female coworkers and bullying of homosexual and/or transgender coworkers. (Id.)  

Adenrele was employed by MARTA in 2015 to perform non-mechanical maintenance and cleaning on its bus fleet. (Award at 7.) He had a history of discipline throughout his career at MARTA, although he was also cleared of some charges that were found to be unsubstantiated. (Award at 8.) In one incident of particular relevance, Shyanne Lord ("Lord") accused her of inappropriate touching as part of an investigation of multiple allegations of misconduct; the specific allegation by Lord was found to be unsubstantiated, but Adenrele recieved discipline as a result of that investigation for violation of MARTA's Workplace Violence policy. (Award at 8-9. 18.) He was subsequently disciplined again in 2018 and 2019 for incidents unrelated to Lord or to sexual harassment allegations. (Award at 9.)

Lord filed suit against MARTA in 2019; discovery was conducted in that action, which ultimately was resolved by payment of a substantial settlement amount. (Award at 9, 18.) In the arbitration, MARTA claimed that its termination of Adenrele was justified by an investigation it conducted in 2020 after deponents in the lawsuit allegedly substantiated Lord's original 2017 allegation. (Id.)

In addition to documents relating to the Lord allegations, MARTA also sought to introduce evidence of additional conduct it alleged justified the termination, in the form of an EEOC charge of discrimination filed in 2022 by Zaneisha Lynch ("Lynch") and a letter from Lynch's attorneys to the CEO of MARTA threatening suit. (Award at 9-10, 19.) MARTA presented no witness testimony at the arbitration. (Award at 7-8, 22.)

The arbitrator found that ATU timely initiated a grievance. (Award at 11.) The arbitrator also found that MARTA failed to provide requested documents during the grievance process and notiably did not provide any documentation or notice regarding the Lynch allegations, and instead simply repeated provided copies of documents relating to the 2017 investigation that had previously been unsubstantiated. (Award at 11-13.)

The arbitrator also found that, after repeated failures by MARTA to provide a copy of a termination packet for Adenrele, ATU sent an open records request to MARTA's legal department, which did not respond, which failure to respond the arbitrator found, and MARTA admitted, to be in violation of Georgia law. (Award at 14.)

At the completion of the grievance process, the arbitration was conducted. It took place over two hearing days; however, ATU rested its case on the second day in protest over the fact that MARTA replaced its corporate representative with attorneys, premised on their position that this violated the collective bargaining agreement. (Award at 15.)

The arbitrator found that MARTA had failed to meet its burden at arbitration, concluding that "mere allegation,-- without evidence to support them, do not constitute proof." (Award at 19-20.) She also found significant due process and contractual violations by MARTA that undermined the greivance process. (Award at 20.)

To begin with, the documents regarding the Lynch allegations were not provided to ATU until the actual arbitration proceeding; her name was not even mentioned during the grievance process in relation to the termination, despite numerous requests, including requests under Georgia's Open Records Act, in violation of both Georgia law and the collective bargaining agreement. (Award at 20-21.) As a consequence of this, the documents and the Lynch allegation were excluded from evidence. (Award at 22.)

Nor did MARTA present new evidence justifying its attempt to revisit its 2017 discipline decision relating to Lord. (Award at 22-23.) The arbitrator found:

The Employer’s lack of evidence quite transparently demonstrates that MARTA did not actually rely on any new infraction committed by the Grievant to support the discharge decision. What is gleaned from MARTA’s own exhibits and its presentation at the hearing is that in early 2020, MARTA found itself faced with lawsuits from several former employees, and MARTA management was placed under intense scrutiny by the public and the news media. 5 Faced with these pressures, MARTA management determined that it had no alternative but to get rid of the Grievant, and in order to effectuate that result, MARTA improperly relied on earlier incidents of misconduct which had already been the subject of the disciplinary process and for which the Grievant had already been disciplined.

(Award at 23.)

Citing arbitral precedent, which MARTA does not contest herein, the arbitrator found that the doctrine of double jeopardy, and underlying principles of industrial due process, prevented her from finding that Adenrele's termination was just and properly conducted. (Award at 23-25.)
She also found that the failure properly to notify ATU of the charges presented at arbitration and the extreme delay between 2017 and the termination were violations of the bargaining agreement and due process. (Award at 26-27.) The arbitrator concluded that the termination must be rescinded. (Award at 28-29.)

Governing Law and Procedural Posture

On a motion to vacate that award, ATU submits that the primary governing law is the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), which does not entirely occupy the field but preempts conflicting state law regarding arbitration. See Marmet Health Care Ctr., Inc. v. Brown, 132 S. Ct. 1201, 1202 (2012) ("State and federal courts must enforce the Federal Arbitration Act...with respect to all arbitration agreements covered by that statute."). The coverage of the FAA "represents the full extent of Congress's Commerce Clause power. Bean v. ES Partners, Inc., 533 F. Supp. 3d 1226, 1231 (S.D.Fl. 2021). Accordingly, the primary point of reference on the present motion should be 9 USC § 1 et seq., not OCGA § 9-9-13.

ATU notes at this point that the present motion may be untimely. Under the FAA, a motion to vacate an award "must be served on the adverse party or his attorney within three months after the award is filed or delivered." 9 USC § 12; Galindo, 241 Ga. App. at 84. Here, the award was entered on January 11, 2023, and this action was filed in this Court on April 12, 2023, but not served until May 1, 2023. Accordingly, it appears to be untimely under the FAA. ATU notes that the Georgia Arbitration Act and OCGA 9-9-13(b) contain a similar time limitation in OCGA § 9-9-13(a) but do not appear to require service within the time period. Accordingly, to the extent these rules are in conflict, the federal statute preempts state law and the present motion should be dismissed.

The Georgia courts have jurisdiction to apply the FAA in actions for the confirmation or vacation of awards subject to the FAA. Galindo v. Lanier Worldwide, 241 Ga. App. 78 (1999). Under the FAA, review of an arbitration award for legal error is not permitted, even when the parties themselves have contracted for such review, which is not the case here. Hall St. See Assocs., L.L.C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U.S. 576, 586-87 (2008). While the Mattel holding expressly contemplates that "more searching review" might be possible under "state statutory schemes," (Mattel, 552, U.S. at 590), it also notes as a matter of public policy that limited review encourages arbitration by ensuring that it is not merely a prelude to "full-bore legal and evidentiary appeals." Moreover, in any event and as discussed in more detail below, Georgia's statutory scheme does not permit review by this court for legal error either.

Under the FAA, the vacation of an award is governed by 9 USC § 10, which provides for vacation on the following grounds:

(1)where the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means;
(2)where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators, or either of them;
(3)where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced; or
(4)where the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.

9 USC § 10.

While this does not expressly include the two primary grounds asserted by MARTA, public policy and manifest disregard of the law, it has been interpreted to include these, albeit in a more defined and restrictive manner than MARTA contends. For example, the United States Supreme Court has held that public policy review of an arbitration agreement must be "based on review of existing laws and legal precedents demonstrating well defined and dominant policy" and expressly rejects review based on "general considerations of supposed public interest." United Paperworkers Int'l Union v. Misco, Inc., 484 U.S. 29, 43 (1987).

Similarly, the ground of alleged "manifest disregard" does not amount to review for legal error. Manifest disregard must involve some showing that the arbitrator knew the law, was not mistaken about it, and knowingly and deliberately disregarded it. O.R. Sec., Inc. v. Prof'l Planning Assocs., 857 F.2d 742, 747 (11th Cir. 1988). What is required is much more than a showing of mere mistake. Georgia's statutory scheme requires a similar showing. Brooks v. Brooks, 366 Ga. App. 650, 655  (2023) (proof of manifest disregard is extremely difficult and requires concrete evidence of specific intent by the arbitrator to disregard applicable law).

Manifest Disregard

MARTA alleges with respect to its "manifest disregard" ground that the arbitrator disregarded Title VII and refused to allow pertinent evidence. Both contentions lack merit.

Nowhere in the arbitration award does the arbitrator disregard Title VII or determine that the alleged conduct of Mr. Adenrele would not have merited termination if the proper procedures had been followed and sufficient evidence submitted to the arbitrator. In fact, quite the contrary:

As a starting point for this discussion, there is no doubt that the allegations against the Grievant paint a disturbing picture. Had MARTA come forward with persuasive evidence to support the veracity of these allegations as they were presented in its opening statement and its brief, and, had MARTA fairly handled the disciplinary process, this Arbitrator might be inclined to agree that discipline not only was fully warranted, but that discharge was the only suitable penalty for the Grievant’s misdeeds. That said, mere allegations, -- without evidence to support them, do not constitute proof. Moreover, based on the overall record it is patently clear that MARTA committed a number of due process and contractual violations which undoubtedly warrant a finding that the Grievant’s right to a fair grievance process and hearing was infringed upon by the Authority.

Award at 19-20.

The arbitrator in this case found significant and serious process violations by MARTA and an absence of evidence of wrongdoing justified overturning the discipline imposed on an employee for his alleged conduct. Overturning this award based on an argument about the seriousness of the alleged underlying conduct would be the equivalent of arguing that an arbitrator is never authorized to consider either due process or the sufficiency of evidence and must simply make decisions based on the seriousness of the allegation itself. It amounts to the imposition of an industrial death sentence without due process. See PSC Custom v. United Steel, Paper & Forestry, Rubber, Mfg., Energy, Allied Indus. & Serv. Workers Int'l Union, Local No. 11-770, 756 F.3d 627, 631 (2014) ("Even if we disagreed with the arbitrator's notion of due process, arbitrators have long been applying notions of 'industrial due process' to 'just cause' discharge cases.")

Public Policy

Regarding public policy, MARTA cites Matter of Phillips v Manhattan & Bronx Surface Tr. Operating Auth., 132 A.D.3d 149 (NY 2015). Review of this case is instructive. In Phillips, the arbitrator ordered reinstatement of an individual on the sole basis that a transit authority had violated its collective bargaining agreement relating to the imposition of discipline on employees while on union-paid release status, essentially finding that employees in certain categories could not be disciplined for Title VII violations. This amounted to a finding that the collective bargaining agreement trumped Title VII, and the New York court properly found it to be the rare case where public policy mandated vacation of an arbitration award.

Here, the union did contest the allegations against Adenrele, and the arbitrator made no such finding; instead, she expressly and repeatedly found that MARTA had not met its burden of proof. MARTA argues, in essense, that this doesn't matter, that Title VII trumps any consideration of due process, and that the double jeopardy rule the arbitrator here relied on does not apply in any case where Title VII, or any other federal statute deemed of sufficient seriousness, is invoked.

ATU submits, to the contrary, that the fact that Congress has articulated a public policy against sexual harrassment in the workplace does not do away with fundamental considerations of fairness and due process, which are also public policies of the United States.

In City of Ansonia v. Stanley, 48 Conn. Supp. 574 (2004), another case cited by MARTA, an arbitration panel found as a matter of fact that a police officer had engaged in criminal sexual misconduct on duty but nonetheless ordered his reinstatement because of a "nonprejudicial procedural violation," in this case a nonprejudicial delay in acting on written complaints. In Stanley, as in Phillips, the arbitral decision was properly overturned because it amounted to a finding that procedural rights under the collective bargaining agreement that did not impact the fundamental fairness of the proceedings outweighed the public policy of protecting persons from sexual misconduct.

Here, again, the principals invoked by the arbitrator were not simply abstract procedural rights under the collective bargaining agreement with no due process implication; they were rights fundamental to the process of making a fair determination of the issues. The most fundamental issue being double jeopardy:

The decision here is not based on a finding that the Grievant is innocent, but instead is based on this arbitrator’s refusal to sustain a discharge based solely on hearsay and references to past, already-adjudicated infractions, instead of on probative evidence confirming that there was a more recent transgression which triggered the discharge.

Award at 28.

Pertinent and Material Evidence

Regarding the evidentiary issue, under the FAA an award may be vacated for refusal by the arbitrator to hear pertinent and material evidence. This requires a showing of something more than the evidentiary exclusion of evidence, however. In Gulf Coast Indus. Workers Union v. Exxon Co., USA, 70 F.3d 847 (5th Cir. 1995), for example, the arbitrator misled a party by telling it not to present certain evidence and then using the failure to present that evidence as an excuse to exclude other evidence, leading to a decision that was fundamentally unfair. This ground only applies when the exclusion amounts to misconduct that "deprive[s] the party of the opportunity to present its case in a meaningful manner." Mantle v. Upper Deck Co., 956 F. Supp. 719, 731-32 (N.D.TX 1997).

Here, the arbitrator excluded evidence from the record on the grounds that MARTA violated its obligations under both the collective bargaining agreement and Georgia's open records law by not providing copies of the relevant documents prior to the hearing. Award at 20-22. Moreover, it is worth noting, as the arbitrator does, that the "excluded evidence" MARTA complains of consists of an EEOC charge of discrimination form and a demand letter from an attorney; no attempt to introduce substantive evidence in the form of actual witness testimony was made. Award at 22n4.

Confirmation

Pursuant to 9 USC § 9 or other applicable law, this Court is authorized to confirm the arbitration award at issue herein and should for reasons set forth in more detail above.

WHEREFORE, ATU respectfully prays that the Award be confirmed, that the petition to vacate same be denied, and that the Court grant such other and further relief as it deems proper and just.
