 This is the deposition of Arphie Jane Cole, taken pursuant to notice and agreement of counsel under the Georgia Civil Practice Act for purpose of discovery and all other purposes allowable by law. My understanding is that we will be reserving objections, except to the form of the question and responsiveness of the answer, until the first lawful use of the deposition, is that agreeable? Would you like to put something on the record about signature?

Swear

Ms. Cole, my name is Paul Menair, I'm an attorney with Steven Leibel PC and I represent Ms. Crystal Sparks in the lawsuit against you.

Have you ever given sworn testimony before?

I am going to ask you a series of questions. You are under oath. Do you understand what it means to be under oath?

The court reporter will be trying to make a written transcript of what we say here today, and it helps her if we try not to talk over each other, okay?

Please let me know if I interrupt you before you're finished, or if you don't understand a question, otherwise I will assume that you understood the question and gave me a complete response. Is that fair?

Please also try and keep in mind that the usual noises and hand signals and head nods that people use to communicate with don't translate very will into writing, alright?

I am happy to take a break at any time you like, but if there's a question on the table I will ask you to answer it before you leave the room, fair enough?

Comments from CCS:

"This was a minor impact collision with all injuries being pre-existing
-- She went to ER then had a 2 month gap in treatment then overtreated
at the chiro where she states in her initial eval that her injuries are
from a 2016 MVA and were â€œnever fully resolved" - the Peachtree ortho
records would be good if they didn't relate her injuries to a previous
MVA. I don't see any adjuster considering the American Health Imaging or
Peachtree Ortho records and bills as being related and I also think they
are going to slash the chiro down at least half and probably more

Being that there is a gap in treatment of 2 months, I don't think an
adjuster is going to consider anything more than the ER treatment. I
think it's worth sending everything except the MRI on 12/28/18 just to
see what they'll do. Explain the gap with her story that she was very
sick...are there any medical records to help substantiate this?" -->
$7,500-10,000

Cabot review suggests she was hurt but recognizes issue with gap between
MRIs.

This is the deposition of Ada Vargas, taken pursuant to notice and agreement of counsel for all purposes allowable under the Georgia Civil Practice Act. I propose we waive objection until the first lawful use of the deposition, except to form or responsiveness of the answer, if that is agreeable to counsel. {We have also stipulated to remote administration of the oath.}

Anything regarding signature at this time?

Please swear the witness.

Ms. Vargas, my name is Paul Menair and I represent the plaintiff in a civil action against you. Have you ever given sworn testimony before, at a deposition or in court?

There are just a few ground rules I always go over before we start, and the first is that you are under oath. Do you understand what that means?

The second thing to remember is that the court reporter is trying to make a verbatim transcript of what we say. This means it's always important for us not to talk over each other. This is especially true because we are doing this by videoconference, and the software really only lets one person talk at a time. Okay?

I am not going to drag this out, but I am also game to take a break whenever you want, if you will agree to answer any question that's on the table before we break, other than questions your lawyer has specifically told you not to answer. Sound fair?

Please do not hesitate to ask me to clarify or rephrase a question, okay?

Alright. Without telling me what was said in any meeting with your lawyer, I assume you met with her to prepare for this deposition, correct?
