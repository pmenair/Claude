PLAINTIFF'S BRIEF IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS' DONALD GERTEISEN AND LINDA GERTEISEN’S RENEWED MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

Plaintiff responds and objects to Defendants' Donald Gerteisen and Linda Gerteisen's Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment as follows:

I. Facts

As previously submitted, Betty Denson (“Denson”) is an elderly woman who lives in Alabama with her husband; she has five children. (Deposition of Betty Denson [“Denson Depo.”], Doc. 46-1, at 9, 16-17.)[1] On October 18, 2018, while staying at a vacation rental property in Sautee Nacoochee, Georgia (the “Premises”) Denson fell while going down a staircase at the Premises (the “Fall” on the “Staircase”). (Doc 46-1 at 17, 38-39, 40-41.) Denson was transported to the hospital after her fall, where she was diagnosed with a subdural hematoma. (Doc. 46-6.) She was subsequently diagnosed with a serious traumatic brain injury. (Doc. 46-7.)
Denson recalls stepping down and feeling like there was nothing to put her foot on, because of the narrow width of the treads along the inside corner of the Staircase. (Denson Depo. at 46, 48-50; see also Staircase Photo, Doc. 46-2.) In the opinion of Mr. Satterfield, Plaintiff’s expert, the Staircase was in violation of applicable codes and standards in a variety of respects. (Deposition of Timothy Satterfield (“Satterfield Depo.”), Doc. 46-3, at 76-96, 104- 107.)[2] This Court has determined that this undisputed testimony establishes that a “structural defect” existed with respect to the Staircase. (Prior Order on Summary Judgment, Doc. 59, at 21.)

[1] The foregoing is essentially identical to the factual statement in Docs. X and X, repeated here for convenience and in lieu of incorporation by reference. Deposition transcripts were previously filed in this case. References to page numbers are to the pages as numbered in the document header created by the Court’s electronic filing system.
[2] Although Satterfield does not have experience specifically as a pre-sale home inspector, he has substantial experience in the area of code and safety inspection, including involvement in the issuance of certificates of occupancy. (Satterfield Depo. at 30:5-31:19.)

At the time of the Fall, Defendants were the owners of the Premises. (Defendant’s Statement of Material Facts, Doc. 43-2, at ¶ 1.) They did not construct the home. (Doc. 43- 2 at ¶¶ 2, 4, and 10.) The Premises were rented to Denson and her family as a short-term vacation rental pursuant to an agreement with Vacasa Vacation Rental (“Vacasa”). (Doc. 43-2 at ¶ 6.)

The agreement between Defendants and Vacasa provides that the Defendants retain “title to, [and] general rights and obligations of ownership in, the Home.” (Vacasa Agreement, Doc. 46-4, at Part II.A.3, p. 3.) The agreement also contains an express warranty that the Premises were “suitable and safe for use as a vacation rental and in compliance with applicable local building, health, and other codes or regulatory requirements.” (Vacasa Agreement, Doc. 46-4, at Part II.A.2, p. 3.) The premises were insured by a policy of insurance that identified the Premises as a secondary residence of Defendants with short term rental only. (Homeowner’s Policy, Doc. 46-5, at 2.)

On September 23, 2022, the Court entered an order awarding summary judgment to Defendants premised on the finding that they were out-of-possession landlords and that Denson failed to meet her burden of showing that Defendants were on constructive notice of the defect because it was of a type that would appear
in a pre-purchase building inspection. (Doc. 59 at 21.) On appeal of that order, noting that the Georgia Supreme Court had issued an instructive decision while the case was pending on appeal, the Eleventh Circuit vacated this Court’s order and remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with its decision, as well as that of the Georgia Supreme Court. (Doc. 67 at 14.)

II. Argument and Citation of Authorities

A. Standard of Decision

The Court grants summary judgment if, but only if, the movant is able to show that there is “no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). In this diversity, the Court applies Georgia law, discussed in more detail below, in deciding issues of state law.

B. Defendants Would Misapply the Efficiency Lodge Framework

Plaintiff has previously briefed the issues presented on remand from the Eleventh Circuit that arise from the decision of the Georgia Supreme Court in Efficiency Lodge v. Neason. 316 Ga. 551 (2023). Accordingly, Plaintiff will confine herself in the present brief to replying to arguments raised by Defendants in reurging their contention that the relationship of the parties at the time of Plaintiff's fall was a landlord-tenant relationship.

To begin with, Plaintiff notes that Defendants contend, in footnote text at the bottom of page 11 of their brief, that "this case does not involve the issue of eviction." However, it most assuredly does, because the unwaivable necessity of eviction is one of the defining characteristics of the landlord-tenant relationship in Georgia. Accordingly, it is necessary for the Court to confront the fact that, if this was a landlord-tenant relationship, it would have been necessary for Defendants to obtain a writ of dispossession if Plaintiff had overstayed her welcome at their home. This legal consequence is absolutely relevant to the intention of the parties surrounding the core issue, ie., whether the Defendants had, in fact, delivered possession in the nature of a tenancy. Efficiency Lodge, 316 Ga. at 557. It is especially relevant to the understanding of what is meant by the "right to exclude" others from property. Id. This should not be confused with a right of privacy; a guest at a hotel has a right to lock the door of the room where they stay and expect not to be intruded upon.

Moreover, Defendants assert that Plaintiff had assumed the day to day activities of "managing and maintaining" the property. This is, however, inconsistent with their agreement with Vacasa (Vacasa Agreement, Doc. 46-4, at Part II.A.2 and 3, p. 3.) and not supported by the cited deposition testimony, which only establishes that Vacasa provided cleaning services and "let [Defendants] know when things needed repaired" (Ms. Gerteisen Depo at 16; see also Mr. Gerteisen Depo. at 19). This is a far cry from any expectation that Plaintiff would provide maintenance services or be responsible for "managing" the property.

Plaintiff also notes that Defendants allege their failure to comply with certain requirements of innkeepers with respect to care of personal property of guests "forecloses any alternative conclusion," but they disregard the possibility that the relationship was that of a mere depository for hire or, as Plaintiff has previously argued, simply that of a property owner and invitee. Overall, their argument lack merit and fail to engage fully with the issues as presented by the Eleventh Circuit.

C. Even if the Gerteisens Were Landlords, They Cannot Avoid Liability Here Because the Defect Was a Code Violation and a Patent Defect in Residential Premises

Even if the Court were to determine, under Efficiency Lodge, that the relationship at issue here was one between landlords and tenant, the undersigned respectfully requests that the Court reconsider its ruling on the issue that follows, ie., whether they might be held liable under OCGA § 44-7-14. The Eleventh Circuit does not reach this issue, and the authority previously cited in briefing on this issue does not expressly require, and should not be interpreted to require, a litigant to present expert testimony from a specific expert in support of the contention that a defect is "the kind that would have been discovered during a pre-purchase building inspection," so as to put a landlord on constructive notice of a defect requiring remediation even under the framework of OCGA § 44-7-14.  WCE Holdings B, LLC v. Lewis, 870 S.E.2d 522, 525 (2022). The Lewis court, and its predecessors in holding on this issue, was simply attempting to distinguish between defects that would be identified in routine inspection and defects only identified after the fact on detailed forensic examination. Plaintiff is aware of no Georgia court holding that expert testimony on the question is necessary to survive summary judgment. 

D. Whether or Not the Gerteisens Were in Possession, They Had Superior Knowledge

The Georgia Supreme Court  has  held  that  a slip-and-fall  plaintiff only required to address the issue of her own alleged negligence in  plain, palpable, and undisputed cases. Robinson v. Kroger, 268 Ga. 735, 739-40, 493 (1997) (“Where reasonable minds can differ as to the conclusion to be reached with regard to the questions of whether...an invitee exercised reasonable care for personal safety, summary adjudication is not
appropriate.”). Under Robinson, the issue  on  summary  judgment, in all but the rare case falling under the plain and palpable standard, is the defendant’s actual or constructive knowledge of the specific hazard at at issue.

Put another way, Georgia law generally disfavors an award of summary judgment based on superior knowledge. For example, in Wingo V. Harrison, 268 Ga. App. 156, 601 S.E.2d 507(2004), relied on by the Gerteisens, summary judgment was not decided by some balancing test assessing fault between the plaintiff and the defendant based on their respective knowledge of a hazard, but rather on the basis that there was no evidence that the property owner had actual or constructive knowledge of any problem with a wooden deck, which collapsed due to some latent construction defect, the nature of which does not seem to have been clear even on the appellate record. 

Here, Denson has raised at the very least a genuine issue of material fact for the jury as to whether the Gerteisens had constructive knowledge of the defect, which was apparent to this Court and is apparent in the photograph in the record. (Docs. 46-2 and 59 at 21.)

Moreover, defects constituting violations of applicable building codes may be negligence per se in a premises case, "and evidence of nonconformity with code standards may be proof of the landowner's superior knowledge of a defect under OCGA § 51-3-1." Hall v. Noble-Interstate Mgmt. Grp., LLC, 349 Ga. App. 661, 664 (2019) (quoting Hicks v. Walker , 262 Ga. App. 216, 218 (2003)).[fn][Plaintiff notes that in addition to the general duty of a property owner to invitees the Gerteisens may have had a contractual duty to Denson to maintain the premises in compliance with applicable codes, an undertaking that they made to Vacasa expressly and, the undersigned would argue, impliedly to Denson in marketing the property for vacation use. See OCGA §§ 53-1-6 and 53-1-8. However, it is not necessary to undergo this contractual analysis as the duty plainly exists under OCGA § 51-3-1.] This is also true in the case of landlord-tenant cases, where the premises at issue are residential and the relevant defect is patent. In cases involving patent defects in residential property, a landlord cannot hide behind the usual rules of non-liability to avoid the consequences of failure to remediate a code violation. As stated in Johnston v. Ross, 264 Ga. App. 252 (2003):

Generally, a landowner is not liable for injuries to an invitee arising from a patent defect on the premises preexisting the arrival of the invitee and of which the invitee knew or had the means of knowing equal to the landowner. As we have noted, however, a landlord may not hide behind this general principle to avoid duties imposed by statutes or housing codes.

Johnston, 264 Ga. App. at 253-54. See also Parke Towne N. Apartments, LLC v. Castro, 349 Ga. App. 692 (2019); Watts v. Jaffs 216 Ga. App. 565, 565-566 (1995); Bastien v. Metropolitan Park Lake Assoc. 209 Ga. App. 881 (1993). See also Restatement (Second) of Property, § 17.6, comment a ("the rule of this section is based on the assumption that the statute or regulation represents a legislative determination of the standard of conduct required of the landlord, so that the violation constitutes negligence per se...The tort liability of the landlord in this situation tends to increase the likelihood that the will of the legislature as expressed in the statute or regulation will be effectuated.")

This rule seems inconsistent with cases like Martin v. Hansen, 755 S.E.2d 892 (2014), which applied the rule of OCGA § 44-7-14 to relieve a residential landlord of liability. However, the defect in Martin, a minor difference in tread height (much like the defenct in (Rainey v. 1600 Peachtree, 255 Ga. App. 299 (2002))) was determined by the Court to be a latent, not a patent, defect. In cases involving defects that are patent, ie. obvious, like a low railing (Castro) or the lack of a handrail (Bastien and Watts), landlords, even out-of-possession landlords, are not entitled to avail themselves of the ordinary premises liability defenses that support summary judgment (although they may still rely on such negligence defenses as assumption of the risk and contributory negligence, which are matters for the jury).

Plaintiff submits that the defect at issue in this case is sufficiently patent that it should have been obvious to Defendants who, one must assume, had repeatedly traversed it themselves. (Doc. 46-2.) Indeed, as noted below, Defendants essentially concede as much in their prior briefing on summary judgment by arguing that the prior traversal doctrine and/or assumption of the risk bars recovery in this case. It is, in any event, plainly defective and in violation of various building codes. Accordingly, if it is sufficiently patent to provide them with a defense of superior knowledge under ordinary circumstances, the fact that it represents a code violation that would also disallow that defense.

E. Denson's Prior Traversal Does Not Absolve the Gerteisens from Liability

As is often the case in premises litigation, Defendants attempt to suggest that Georgia law provides that any prior traversal constitutes an automatic and entire defense against liability. The prior traversal rule is an extension of “open and obvious static condition doctrine" and the plain and palpable standard, and it provides a defense only in cases where the hazard was sufficiently patent that it should have been obvious to the plaintiff.

Numerous cases have held that a genuine issue of fact exists for trial despite a prior traversal. See, e.g., Christensen v. Overseas Partners Capital, 249 Ga. App. 827  (2001) (prior traversal of height gap at the end of a handicap rampt); Perkins v. Val D’Aosta Co.,305 Ga. App. 126 (2010) (prior traversal of poorly lit curb after a period of time).

Most closely analogous to this case, in  Aggeles v.  Theater of the Stars, 235 Ga. App. 57, 507 S.E.2d 856 (1998) (physical precedent only), a patron fell in astairwell because the railing stopped five  or  six  steps  above  the  end  of  the  staircase. The  Court of Appeals reversed summary judgment, despite the fact that the patron- plaintiff was elderly, needed to utilize railings in staircases, and had actually used  an  identical  railing  during  a prior  traversal  on  the  opposite  side  of  the staircase where she fell. Id. at 507 S.E.2d 857-58. See also Murray v. W. Bldg. Materials, 243 Ga. App. 834 (2000) (physical precedent only) (relying on Aggeles in acase involving similar facts). Recently, see Stewart v. Brown, 343  Ga App. 190, 193, 806 S.E.2d 640, 643 (2017) (citing Murray with approval).

Here, if the hazard at issue was sufficiently obvious for the prior traversal rule to apply, as argued above, it was sufficiently obvious that the code violation constituted negligence per se and the Defendants should not be entitled to rely on such defenses. If it was not, and they were not charged with that duty, then the prior traversal rule cannot apply.

E. Assumption of the Risk Is a Jury Issue

In Robinson v. Kroger, 268 Ga. 735, 493 S.E.2d 403 (1997), the Georgia Supreme Court overruled a large number of Georgia Court of Appeals’ decisions in which the lower appellate court had held that the
plaintiff’s  failure  to  observe  a visible  hazard  was  itself  a basis  for  summary judgment:

[B]y routinely adjudicating as amatter of law questions of the plaintiff’s and defendant’s negligence, proximate cause, and the exercise of ordinary care, these decision have made the commonplace what is, in reality, an unusual circumstance in tort law, since as a general proposition, issues of negligence, contributory negligence and lack of ordinary care for one's own safety are not susceptible to summary adjuciation.

Here, Denson's negligence in traversing the stairs, if any, was not plain and palpable. Indeed, it is inconsistent of the Gerteisens to argue that the hazard here was obvious to any person of ordinary
intelligence, but also that it somehow was not obvious to them. Although an assumption of the risk defense is available in premises liability cases, it requires a showing that: (1) the plaintiff had actual knowledge of the specific dangerous condition, (2) understood the risk, and (3) voluntarily exposed herself to it. Daly v. Berryhill, 308 Ga. 831, 834 (Ga. 2020). Put another way, "[t]he affirmative defense of assumption of the risk bars a plaintiff from recovering on a negligence claim if it is established that [she,] without coercion of circumstances, chooses a course of action with full knowledge of its danger and while exercising a free choice as to whether to engage in the act or not." Vaughn v. Pleasent, 266 Ga. 862, 864 (1996) (footnote and punctuation omitted). Plaintiff submits that this defense plainly should not be available to the defendants in this case as a matter of law. See generally Watson v. Reg'l First Care, Inc., 335 Ga.App. 740, 741 (2016) (assumption of the risk is a matter for the jury). See generally Robinson v. Kroger (disapproving summary judgment premised on assessment of plaintiff's contributory fault).

IV. Conclusion

---

RESPONSE TO DEFENDANTS DONALD GERTEISEN AND LINDA GERTEISEN’S STATEMENT OF UNDISPUTED MATERIAL FACTS IN SUPPORT OF THEIR RENEWED MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

Plaintiff, pursuant to Local Rule 56.1(B)(2)(a), responds to movant's statement of purportedly undisputed facts as follows:

1. At the time of the Incident alleged in the Complaint, Defendants owned a two-bed, two-bath cabin home near Helen, Georgia located at 515 Two Johns Way, Sautee Nacoochee, Georgia 30571 (the “Property”). (Excerpts from Deposition of Linda Gerteisen (“Ms. Gerteisen Depo”), attached to Defendants SUMF as Exhibit “A,” p. 10:19-24).
RESPONSE: Not controverted at this time.

2. The Property was built in 1997 by Mr. John Kubler. (Excerpts from Deposition of Donald Gerteisen (“Mr. Gerteisen Depo.”), attached to Defendants SUMF as Exhibit “B,” p. 12:7-14; Affidavit of John Kubler (“Kubler Aff.”) ¶ 3, attached to Defendants SUMF as Exhibit “C.”)
RESPONSE: Not controverted at this time.

3. The Property was built as a spec house pursuant to a Southern Living design plan and no modification to the Southern Living plan were made. (Kubler Aff. ¶ 4).
RESPONSE: Not controverted at this time.

4. Mr. Kubler never received or was made aware of a notice or citation regarding any code violations at the Property prior to the sale of the Property to Defendants in 2002. (Kubler Aff. ¶ 5).
RESPONSE: Not controverted at this time.

5. Prior to the sale to Defendants, the Property was permitted, passed all county inspections, and received a certificate of occupancy. (Kubler Aff. ¶ 6-7).
RESPONSE: Not controverted at this time.

6. At the time of the Incident, the Property was a rental property that was managed and rented through Vacasa Vacation Rentals (“Vacasa”). (Ms. Gerteisen Depo. pp. 15:25-16:5; Mr. Gerteisen Depo. pp. 19:22 to 20:3; 18:12 to 19:5). Case 2:20-cv-00228-SCJ Document 75-2 Filed 11/15/23 Page 2 of 11
RESPONSE: Not controverted at this time.

7. Prior to using Vacasa, Defendants utilized other rental management companies, including Tanglewood Cabin Rentals. (Mr. Gerteisen Depo. p. 16:6-10).
RESPONSE: Not controverted at this time.

8. The Property features a wooden staircase that connects the main floor to the upstairs bedrooms. (Exhibit 5 to the Deposition of Betty Denson (“Plaintiff Depo.”), attached to Defendants SUMF as Exhibit “D”).
RESPONSE: Not controverted at this time.

9. The staircase turns before the bottom two steps using two “winder” steps, or triangle shaped platform steps. (Plaintiff Depo. – Exhibit 5).
RESPONSE: Plaintiff admits that the citation is a reference to a photograph of the staircase at issue in this matter; the referenced material does not support the contention that the stairs may be described by any particular architectural term or the implication that this is a standard or appropriate architectural feature.

10. At the time Defendants purchased the property, Mr. Kubler represented to Defendants that he was unaware of any issues with the property or staircase, including any violations of building codes or zoning regulations. (Kubler Aff. ¶ 3-7).
RESPONSE: Not controverted at this time.

11. The independent inspection of the Property completed at the time of the sale of the Property did not reveal any issue with the staircase. (Mr. Gerteisen Depo. pp. 23:18 to 24:13).
RESPONSE: Plaintiff admits that an inspection was conducted and did not identify any issues; the referenced evidentiary material does not support the inference that there were no issues with the staircase at the time of this inspection that might have been identified.

12. At the time it was leased to Plaintiff, the Property was managed and maintained exclusively by Vacasa, which includes cleaning after every guest, providing towels, sheets, and amenities for guests, and alerting Defendants of the need for any repairs. (Mr. Gerteisen Depo. p.18:4-21; Ms. Gerteisen Depo. pp. 15:25
to 16:6).
RESPONSE: Denied, and the referenced citations do not support the statement. The agreement between Vacasa and the Defendants provides that primary responsibility for maintenance and repair remained with the Gerteisen and Vacasa provided only routine cleaning and other similar services. (Doc. 46-4 at ¶ II.A.3.)

13. Defendants live in Florida and do not occupy the Property. (Ms. Gerteisen Depo. p. 11:16-21; Mr. Gerteisen Depo. p. 6:8-11; 8:13-21).
RESPONSE: Not controverted at this time.

14. At the time of the Incident, inspections of the Property were not performed by Defendants, and Vacasa only inspected the Property after a guest’s stay was completed. (Ms. Gerteisen Depo. p. 16:16-20; Mr. Gerteisen Depo. pp. 18:12 to 19:5; 19:22 to 20:3).
RESPONSE: See Paragraph 12 above.

15. Defendants sold the Property on November 1, 2018. (Ms. Gerteisen Depo. p. 13:5-6).
RESPONSE: Not controverted at this time.

16. During their ownership of the Property, Defendants did not modify or alter the Property’s staircase. (Mr. Gerteisen Depo. p. 14:14-17).
RESPONSE: Not controverted at this time.

17. During the 16 years that Defendants rented the property, they were never notified by any guest of any issue with the staircase. (Ms. Gerteisen Depo. p. 14:13- 19; Mr. Gerteisen Depo. p. 15:3-13).
RESPONSE: Not controverted at this time.

18. Nor were they ever notified by Vacasa or any other rental company managing the Property of any issue with the staircase. (Mr. Gerteisen Depo. pp. 15:3-13; 19:3-5).
RESPONSE: Not controverted at this time.

19. Defendants never personally observed or were otherwise notified of any issue with the staircase at any time during their ownership of the Property.
RESPONSE: Not controverted, if only because it is impossible to controvert Defendants' self serving testimony. No authority is provided, however, the evidence referenced in support of Defendants' prior motion does not support the legal conclusion that no issue existed during that period, nor does it controvert the legal conclusion that they should have observed (or by inspection identified) an issue with the staircase. See the photograph of the staircase, Doc. 76-6.

20. Plaintiff, an 83-year-old resident of Alabama with a long history of prior falling incidents and unstable knees, rented the Property for a stay with her husband, daughter, son-in-law, and family dog. (Excerpts from Plaintiff Depo., attached to Defendants SUMF as Exhibit “E,” pp. 8:20-21; 36:25 to 37:9).
RESPONSE: Not controverted except for the conclusory assertion implied by the phrase "long history," which is not supported by Plaintiff's testimony cited.

21. Upon arrival the Property, Plaintiff took her belongings upstairs and traversed the staircase without issue. (Excerpts from Deposition of Sidney Denson (“Mr. Denson Depo.),” attached to Defendants SUMF as Exhibit “F,” p. 16:6-24).
RESPONSE: Not controverted at this time.

22. Later that evening, Plaintiff fell while traversing down the staircase. (Plaintiff Depo. p. 46:13-25).
RESPONSE: Not controverted at this time.

23. Plaintiff does not know how she fell.
Q: Okay. Ms. Denson, what do you think caused you to fall?
A: I really don't know. I know how I think it happened, but I don't
know -- I don't know why.
(Plaintiff’s Depo. p. 48:8-12).
RESPONSE: Denied. (See Plaintiff’s Depo. at 45-49.)

24. Plaintiff is uncertain as to which step contributed to her fall:
Q: Which [step]?
A: I really don't know which one. Not really.
(Plaintiff’s Depo. p. 46:13-15).
RESPONSE: Not controverted. However, Plaintiff’s testimony was that she fell near the bottom of the stairs when her foot missed one of the steps where they became narrow around the turn. (See Plaintiff’s Depo. at 45-49.)

25. There were no witnesses to Plaintiff’s fall. (Plaintiff’s Depo. p. 46:20-21).
RESPONSE: Not controverted at this time.

26. Plaintiff reported to her physicians a month prior to the incident that she felt “unsteady on her feet.” (Plaintiff’s Depo. p. 24:5-19).
RESPONSE: Not controverted at this time.

27. Plaintiff has a history of chronic knee pain and knee instability, to the extent her physicians noted she “required 24/7 care due to the pain and the fact that her knee is unstable.” (Plaintiff Depo. pp. 32:6 to 33:8; Exhibit 3 to Plaintiff Depo., attached to Defendants SUMF as Exhibit “G”; Excerpts from Deposition of Dr. Melissa Gray (“Gray Depo.),” attached to Defendants SUMF as Exhibit “H,” p. 42:7-23).
RESPONSE: Not controverted; however, the referenced discussion is a discussion of Plaintiff’s condition in 2015.

28. Due to the instability in her knees, Plaintiff was of the condition where she could not get up, prepare meals, or use the bathroom by herself, and “[s]he was just really unsteady on her feet at that time.” (Gray Depo. p. 42:18-23).
RESPONSE: Not controverted; however, the referenced discussion is a discussion of Plaintiff’s condition in 2015.

29. Dr. Gray’s notes reflect that Plaintiff has had at least three falls in 2015 and advised Plaintiff to use some type of walking assistance tool (Gray Depo. pp. 42:7- 23; 50:22-25).
RESPONSE: Not controverted; however, the referenced discussion is a discussion of Plaintiff’s condition in 2015.

30. As of October 8, 2019, Plaintiff still suffered from the same chronic knee condition and unsteadiness of her feet:
Q: And at this September 4th, 2018, visit Ms. Denson was still
complaining of the same chronic knee pain she had for years?
A.: Yes.
Q: And she was still complaining that she felt unsteady on her feet?
A: Yes.
(Gray Depo. pp. 54:20 to 55:2).
RESPONSE: Plaintiff admits that she was suffering from knee pain and unsteadiness of her feet at the time of her doctor’s visit on September 4, 2018. The referenced material does not support the contention that her condition at that time was exactly the same as it had been three years prior in 2015.

31. As of October 8, 2019, Plaintiff remained prescribed for Norco, a pain medication, three times a day, which increased her risk of fall. (Gray Depo. pp. 29:15-19; 51:1-7; 54:16-19).
RESPONSE: Plaintiff admits that she was prescribed Norco at various times. However, the referenced material does not support the conclusion that Plaintiff was under the influence of Norco at the time of her fall; Plaintiff’s testimony is that she was not under the influence of any medications at the time of her fall. (See Plaintiff’s Depo. at 49.)

32. As a result of the fall, Plaintiff alleges she sustained an injury to her head.
(Plaintiff Depo. p. 40:9-25).
RESPONSE: Not controverted at this time.
