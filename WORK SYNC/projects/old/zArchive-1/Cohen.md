Paul, 
Sorry this is late but after today, I went home exhausted. I feel bad about getting confused over the accidents, I know to someone that didn't experience this situation, that it sounds easy to remember events but it's really not for me, I get confused now and don't understand things easily, I assure you, before this last accident, I was very sharp and could remember everything.  After I left your office, I sat in the car and had to write down everything you needed from me so that I wouldn't forget it. My desk at home has sticky notes all over it so that I don't forget things. Dr. Charek said that once I get on a schedule the memory problem will start to improve, it's just hard now to get on a schedule when I basically have nothing to schedule for right now. I promise, I wouldn't be going through all this for a take home of only $50k if it wasn't real. I don't think we asked for much, I don't remember how we came up with the numbers but if you think the number is ridiculous let me know and we can talk about adjusting it, I just think this number is what I need to get back to normal and would make me feel relieved after seeing my savings account every month get lower. If you think this number is realistic, then I'm willing to go all the way to get it, we have nothing to lose because the $5k doesn't even cover Dr. Cody's bills that I already paid. Plus the medical expenses will get larger the longer we wait for a court date. Dr. Cody said that this procedure may need to be done a couple times, it probably isn't a one time fix plus I'm paying COBRA now so that I have the good benefits to cover all these procedures with a low deductible. I also want to pay back my savings account for the over $5k I used to pay for all these procedures, then if there is money left over I'm about $10K under on my car and I'd like to get rid of it and get one that hasn't been jinxed by 2 accidents, that would use up the $50K probably.  It's not like I'm retiring early to become a beach bum on $50K. Now that I'm home, I see the car accident commercials all day and those numbers they advertise are way higher than what we asked for by several 0s, I know those numbers aren't real but to me it sounds like our number is very reasonable then. I see Dr. Cody on Monday morning for my check up after the procedure and I'll see what he says the next steps are, if I need to get the other side done, I will.  I do feel some relief but he said I wouldn't feel the full effects for several weeks or a month. 

Below are my character references. I spoke to my friend David this evening and he's going to check his texts to see what person I couldn't remember and he said he'd be happy to be a reference. Bruce is my Cumming neighbor who is actually the person that had brought me to the procedure appointments since I couldn't drive and he said he'd be happy to verify my ailments and character, he and his wife are like parents I never had. Both references know me very well and both of them are good people that have very clean backgrounds. I can't think of anyone else that knows about this since I don't share things easily, maybe that's why I've never been married. 😂

I submitted this evening the Anthem Subrogation Form so if you get a call from them you know what it is for. I'm pretty sure they want to be reimbursed, but sounds like it helps us so after a bad day this is good news. 

Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else from me. Again, thank you very much for all your help and have a good evening!!!

David Jackels- (678) 618-3933 (previous Atlanta officer now is an officer in Habersham, I don't know his rank or anything as he's only know to me as David) 
Bruce Bieler-- (470) 302-6374 (retired Controller from Connecticut) 



Thank you, 

Rachael Cohen

# OUTLINE

This is the deposition of Charles McCravy, taken pursuant to notice and agreement of counsel under the Georgia Civil Practice Act for purpose of discovery and all other purposes allowable by law. My understanding is that we will be reserving objections, except to the form of the question and responsiveness of the answer, until the first lawful use of the deposition, is that agreeable? Would you like to put something on the record about signature?

Swear

Mr. McCravy, my name is Paul Menair, I'm an attorney with Steven Leibel PC and I represent Rachel Cohen in the lawsuit against you.

Have you ever given sworn testimony before?

I am going to ask you a series of questions. You are under oath. Do you understand what it means to be under oath?

The court reporter will be trying to make a written transcript of what we say here today, and it helps her if we try not to talk over each other, okay?

Please let me know if I interrupt you before you're finished, or if you don't understand a question, otherwise I will assume that you understood the question and gave me a complete response. Is that fair?

Please also try and keep in mind that the usual noises and hand signals and head nods that people use to communicate with don't translate very will into print, alright?

I am happy to take a break at any time you like, but if there's a question on the table I will ask you to answer it before you leave the room, fair enough?
