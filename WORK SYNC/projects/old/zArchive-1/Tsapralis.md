jxn, venue)

56 yo at DOL, back and neck pain at North Fulton ER, charted concern
about integrity of prior surgical hardware in back. Rearend at
stoplight. CT spine showed no acute fracture in cervical spine, mild
degenerative spondylosis. Lumbar spine showed fracture, age
indeterminate but likely acute if pain, plus scoliosis and lots of
degenerative disk issues. Rx Lortab. Saw Dr.Â Barnett 2017-11, records
refer to prior visit but not what we have on file. Barnett seems to
think no fracture in the CT, notes radiculopathy, hip and leg pain.
Barnett recommends MRI, limited work schedule. MRI shows osteophytes,
scoliosis, facet arthropathy. Now treating with injections, joint block,
RFA at Specialty clinics spine, continuing pain Rx, medical total
$53,720.50. I don't see a surgical recommendation in the records. CS
thinks it's worth $75,000-$125,000.

Client is still treating. Permanent disability.

Went from temporary to permanent after the accident.
