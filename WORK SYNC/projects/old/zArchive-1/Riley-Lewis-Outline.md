This is the deposition of Dr. Sharon Lewis, taken pursuant to notice and agreement of counsel for all purposes allowable under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. My understanding is that all objections will be reserved until the first lawful use of the transcript and that the parties are all in agreement that Ms. Lewis be deposed by remote videoconference and that she will be under oath today despite the fact that the person administering the oath is in a different physical location than the witness, is that all agreeable to counsel?

Do we want to make a record about signature or wait?

Please swear the witness. 

Dr. Lewis, good afternoon. My name is Paul Menair. I represent Melissa Carey and Wallace Riley in a lawsuit against a number of parties, some of whom might not be the correct parties, arising from the death of Matthew Riley, who was an inmate at Johnson State Prison. I believe you've been deposed before today, correct?

The same ground rules apply as any deposition, with the added wrinkle that we're doing this by videoconference, which makes it especially important for both of us to try not to talk over each other, because the software we're using makes it literally impossible for the Court reporter to hear two people trying to talk at once, okay?

Where are you physically located today? Is there anyone there in the room with you?

Did you meet with anyone to prepare for today's deposition? Without telling me what was said, who was present in that meeting?

Did you review any documents to prepare for today?

We are doing this deposition a little bit out of order, and I'm not pointing fingers at you in that regard, but I would eventually like to see any documents that you used to refresh your recollection for today, okay?

Scribe utilization management? Utilization management. 

[] Emory or Augusta

Would you be able to make those documents available to me today?

I am always happy to take a break, but I will ask you to answer any unobjectionable questions that are on the table before we go on mute, does that sound fair?

Let's start with you, which is the traditional place to start. Where did you grow up?

What is your highest level of education?

Working backwards from that, where do you have degrees from? Where did you graduate from high school?

How did you end up working for the Department of Corrections?

Alliant

I'm not going to ask you for your address or anything like that, I can reach you through counsel, correct?

I will ask you, though, what county you live in?

Do you have any relatives who live in the Atlanta Division of the Northern District of Georgia, which covers Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Douglas, Fulton, Gwinnett, Henry, Newton and Rockdale?

Warner Robbins

Do you attend any religious institutions in any of those counties?

Smart Set, AKA

How about belong to any clubs?

Do you belong to any organizations associated with corrections? Do medical directors for statewide departments of corrections have a listserv, anything like that? Journals?

Do you take any medical journals?

When did you start as the statewide medical director for Georgia?

Where were you before that?

How many direct reports do you have? Who are they?

How does the chain run from you to the individual officers who interact directly with the inmates?

---

If an inmate has a medical need, how is that supposed to be communicated to prison staff, and what happens at that point?

Is that standard operating procedure?

Do you personally set that policy? How is the policy set?

[ ] get policies

How would it be documented? Can I have a copy of any relevant SOPs or other policy documents? Are the published online? Are there policies that aren't published online?

Are medical complaints ever not documented? Never?

How about problem inmates, people who might be make a lot of medical complaints because they want attention or some sort of different treatment, but might not actually be sick? How is that handled?

Who would make the determination that someone is malingering? Again, how is that handled?

Would it be possible that a person who is sort of a complainer might be ignored, if not initially maybe after they've made a bunch of requests?

Do you specifically recall the Matthew Riley case?

How did you become involved?

Do you have an independent recollection, or did you have to refresh it from documents? Any documents we haven't talked about.

We sued a corrections officer named Zelda Cummings who has never worked at the Johnson State facility, is that correct?

[ ] VP Joe Shurina DOC
[ ] MORTALITY REVIEW

Is there a different officer, her sister, who did work for at the place where Matthew Riley was incarcerated?

And her name is Barbara Cummings?

Does she still work for there?

I'll represent that Mr. Riley's medical records indicate that he told people at the hospital he had been experiencing neurological symptoms for about two weeks. And as I believe you know, we've been told that he attempted to bring that to the attention of DOC staff at the prison. But the disclosures that were filed on your behalf by counsel in this case state that Mr. Riley failed to bring those symptoms to the attention of prison medical staff. Sitting here today, do you believe that to be true and correct, that he failed to notify prison medical staff of his symptoms and need for medical attention?

How sure are you of that? Why?

I think there is a difference between notifying medical staff and notifying corrections officers. Do you believe he failed to notify the officers responsible for his custody as well? Sure? Why?

The medical staff at the prison saw the decedent on October 17, 2017, and immediately had him transported to the hospital, correct?

Are they contract employees? Who were the specific medical personnel who saw him, do you know? Do they still work for DOC or its medical contractor?

In this instance, how exactly did Mr. Riley bring his condition to the attention of the medical staff, do we know?

And if someone were to say that they do think he tried to bring his condition to the attention of medical staff, they would be saying something that isn't true, that's your testimony.

You are aware that Mr. Carnes, who was in the facility with Mr. Riley, says that they tried to get medical attention for Mr. Riley but that he was accused of malingering.

But that didn't happen. 

And you know that because?

And you're 100% sure of that.

Have you talked with anyone who would have direct knowledge? Medical personnel, corrections officers, higher level staff, or prisoners? What did they say?

How many people in Riley's area? Is it called a pod?

Would we be able to identify those people, as of October 17, 2018?

How did you find out about Mr. Riley's medical condition, do you recall?

What did you know about Mr. Riley prior to October 17, 2017.

Tell me about your personal involvement in his situation after October 17, 2017.

Did you talk to his family members?

Did you talk to medical staff at your facility?

How about the corrections officers, did you talk with them on or after October 17, 2017, about Mr. Riley.

Antoine Caldwell, same question? Other folks at DOC?

Who did you talk to at the hospital?

Were any of these communications memorialized in writing? Are there any emails we could look at? Have you checked? I know I haven't sent you a document request yet.

Were you involved in any of the decision-making regarding Mr. Riley's treatment? How about the decisions to transfer him between medical facilities?

Was that unusual?

When did you learn that he'd passed away? Who contacted you? What did they say?

Is there anything you or your staff should have done differently regarding Mr. Riley in October of 2017?

Have you made any changes to policy or standard operating procedures at your facility as a consequence of what happened with Mr. Riley?

Who is Denise Eady, and what does she know about this case?

Is there anything I haven't asked you about that might help me understand what happened to Matthew Riley?

I understand that DOC did not have a contract with Atlanta Medical Center at the time of Mr. Riley's transfer, is that correct?

Was there no contract that would have governed billing to DOC for Mr. Riley's treatment at Wellstar Atlanta Medical Center in October of 2017?

I'll represent to you that I have seen a contract between Augusta University and Wellstar Atlanta Medical Center, effective in 2017, which caps claims for treatment of prisoners at 135% of the Medicare Allowable. Was that not relevant to the billing in this matter?

You work for the Department of Corrections, correct?

Were you aware of that agreement for hospital services?

Did you take that agreement into account when you were involved in decisions about where to transfer Mr. Riley?

Are there other facilities where brain mapping could have been conducted in Georgia?

Security?

Did anyone save any money by sending Mr. Riley to Atlanta Wellstar instead of any of those other facilities?

Were they considered? Do you know?

What were the specific factors involved in deciding where to send Mr. Riley?

Who does Nurse Eady work for? Where was she physically located in 2017?

Looks like the neurosurgeon suggested AU or Emory, and you personally intervened and said to send him to AMC? Tell me about that conversation? Did you touch base with anyone else?

Did anyone find out if there were any beds at Emory? Why not?

I have the nursing notes regarding Mr. Riley and this "Hospital Tracker" document. Anything else in his file relevant to his treatment at Navicent or his transfer there from Johnson State?
