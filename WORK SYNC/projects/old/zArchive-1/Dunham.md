# response to 6.4

Dear Fred,

We received your 10 page 6.4 letter of August 20, 2021 and respond as follows:

* We noticed depositions unilaterally after several attempts to communicate with you regarding dates. If you will provide us with dates when you will be available inside of the discovery period, I will be happy to reschedule. Until then, we will proceed as noticed.

* Regarding our client's response to the first request for admission, this request seeks an admission regarding causation, an ultimate issue in the case. We will not supplement.

* Regarding our client's responses to the second and third requests for admission, our client made sufficient admissions regarding the current limits of our client's knowledge. I also still don't understand why you would use the word "mechanism" in this context, except insofar as it may be an attempt to avoid using the word "causation," which would have made it clear that you are really asking for a legal conclusion regarding an ultimate issue in the case. We will not supplement.

* Generally, regarding requests with respect to which my client lacks information, we will supplement to the extent that the requests are not otherwise objectionable and a request for supplementation is made in writing at a later date when our client has further information available.

* Regarding collateral source, we stand by this objection. You have cited mostly federal authority, and the Georgia cases you cite are not binding authority on the question of whether collateral source material is generally discoverable as reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of evidence that will be admissible at trial. Please note that if you want to discuss more narrowly tailored requests for information that is actually likely to be relevant and admissible at trial and is not equally available to your client, like the specific information in the Georgia cases you cite, we would be happy to do so. We will not supplement our client's response to broadly worded demands for information regarding collateral source payments. 

* Interrogatories 4, 5, 11, 13, 21, 22, and 25: We will supplement with verification. I will endeavor to do so by your unilaterally imposed deadline of August 31, 2021.

* Interrogatory 14: Plaintiff's responses to the referenced requests for admission are self-explanatory.

* Interrogatories 15 and 16: Plaintiff's complaint is supported by an affidavit which is responsive to the interrogatory. Plaintiff herself is not a medical professional and is unable to testify under oath regarding the standard of nursing care applicable in this case.

* Interrogatories 17 and 18 are premature contention discovery. We will provide supplementation at a later date on written request.

* Interrogatory 23: Are you suggesting that my client is able to provide exact arrival and departure times respecting visits by family members to a hospital in February of 2019, but is withholding that information for some reason? I think if records exist from which a response to this request might be derived, they are more likely to be in your client's possession.
