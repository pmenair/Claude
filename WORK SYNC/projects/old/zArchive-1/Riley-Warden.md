# Riley Cumming Depo Outline

This is the deposition of Lt. Barbara Cumming, taken pursuant to notice and agreement of counsel for all purposes allowable under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. My understanding is that all objections will be reserved until the first lawful use of the transcript and that the parties are all in agreement that Ms. Lewis be deposed by remote videoconference and that she will be under oath today despite the fact that the person administering the oath is in a different physical location than the witness, is that all agreeable to counsel?

Do we want to make a record about signature or wait?

Please swear the witness. 

Lt. Cumming, good afternoon. My name is Paul Menair. I represent Melissa Carey and Wallace Riley in a lawsuit against a number of parties, some of whom might not be the correct parties, arising from the death of Matthew Riley, who was an inmate at Johnson State Prison. Have you been deposed before today?

The same ground rules apply as any deposition, with the added wrinkle that we're doing this by videoconference, which makes it especially important for both of us to try not to talk over each other, because the software we're using makes it literally impossible for the Court reporter to hear two people trying to talk at once, okay?

Where are you physically located today? Is there anyone there in the room with you?

Did you meet with anyone to prepare for today's deposition? Without telling me what was said, who was present in that meeting?

Did you review any documents to prepare for today?

Do you know if those documents have been produced in this lawsuit? Would you be able to make those documents available to me today?

I am always happy to take a break, but I will ask you to answer any unobjectionable questions that are on the table before we go on mute, does that sound fair?

Let's start with you, which is the traditional place to start. Where did you grow up?

What is your highest level of education?

Working backwards from that, where do you have degrees from? Where did you graduate from high school?

How did you end up working for the Department of Corrections?

Because of what you do for a living, I'm not going to ask you for your address or anything like that, I can reach you through counsel, correct?

[ ] If we were to amend this lawsuit to name you as a party, and I'm not saying we're going to do that, but if we did, would you accept service of the complaint and summons in this case?

I am going ask you, though, what county you live in?

Do you have any relatives who live in the Atlanta Division of the Northern District of Georgia, which covers Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Douglas, Fulton, Gwinnett, Henry, Newton and Rockdale?

Do you attend any religious institutions in any of those counties?

How about belong to any clubs?

Do you belong to any organizations associated with corrections? Do corrections officers have a listserv, anything like that? Journals?

When did you start at Johnson State?

Where were you before that?

How many direct reports do you have? Who are they?

How does the chain run from the warden to the individual officers who interact directly with the inmates?

--> [ ] Name of the good person.

[ ] Daily roster, only kept of file for so long.

If an inmate has a medical need, how is that supposed to be communicated to medical staff, and what happens at that point?

Is that standard operating procedure? Documented where?

Do you know how that is the policy set? Were you involved in any way in setting that policy?

How would a reqeust for medical attention be documented? In the file that was produced to us, or somewhere else?

Can I have a copy of any relevant SOPs or other policy documents? Are they published online? Are there policies that aren't published online?

Are medical complaints ever not documented? Never?

Do individuals ever get disciplined for making false medical reports, or malingering? And I would define malingering as exaggerating or feigning illness.

How do you handle people who might be make a lot of medical complaints because they want attention or some sort of different treatment, but might not actually be sick?

Do requests for medical attention go through you, or are they brought direct from the front line officer to the nursing staff.

Who would make the determination that someone is malingering? 

Would it be possible that a person who is sort of a complainer might be ignored, if not initially maybe after they've made a bunch of requests?

Do you specifically recall the Matthew Riley case?

How did you become involved?

Do you have an independent recollection, or did you have to refresh it from documents? Any documents we haven't talked about.

We sued a corrections officer named Zelda Cumming who has never worked at the Johnson State facility, is that correct? 

Is that your sister?

When did you find out about this lawsuit? Did your sister tell you when she got served?

[ ] email a couple of monthsago

I'll represent that Mr. Riley's medical records indicate that he told people at the hospital he had been experiencing neurological symptoms for about two weeks. And as I believe you know, we've been told that he attempted to bring that to the attention of DOC staff at the prison. But the disclosures that were filed on your behalf by counsel in this case state that Mr. Riley failed to bring those symptoms to the attention of prison medical staff. Sitting here today, do you believe that to be true and correct, that he failed to notify prison medical staff of his symptoms and need for medical attention?

How sure are you of that? Why?

I think there is a difference between notifying medical staff and notifying corrections officers. Do you believe he failed to notify the officers responsible for his custody as well? Sure? Why?

The medical staff at the prison saw the decedent on October 17, 2017, and immediately had him transported to the hospital, correct?

Were you involved in that decision making in any way?

Did you personally observe any of Mr. Riley's neurological symptoms?

Who were the specific medical personnel who saw him, do you know? Do they still work for DOC or its medical contractor?

Tell me about your relationship with those folks.

In this instance, how exactly did Mr. Riley bring his condition to the attention of the medical staff, do we know?

And if someone were to say that they do think he tried to bring his condition to the attention of medical staff, but that corrections officers didn't take his complaints seriously, that person would be saying something that isn't true, is that your testimony.

You are aware that Mr. Carnes, who was in the facility with Mr. Riley, says that they tried to get medical attention for Mr. Riley but that he was accused of malingering.

But that didn't happen. 

We've heard that a disciplinary report was prepared, but as far as I've seen none was produced. Do you know anything about that?

Tell me about the process of preparing disciplinary reports, and how they are collected and preserved.

Would it be possible to make one disappear? Why not?

Are you 100% sure that Riley did not receive discipline for seeking medical attention.

Have you talked with anyone else who works at the prison about this case? Including medical personnal, corrections officers, higher level staff, or prisoners? 

What did they say?

How many people in Riley's area? Is it called a pod?

Would we be able to identify those people, as of October 17, 2018?

How did you find out about Mr. Riley's medical condition, do you recall?

What did you know about Mr. Riley prior to October 17, 2017.

Tell me about your personal involvement in his situation after October 17, 2017.

Did you talk to his family members?

Did you talk to medical staff at your facility?

How about the corrections officers, did you talk with them on or after October 17, 2017, about Mr. Riley.

Antoine Caldwell, same question? Other folks at DOC?

Who did you talk to at the hospital, if anyone?

Did prison staff go with him to the hospital? Who?

Were any of these communications memorialized in writing? Are there any emails we could look at? Have you checked? I know I haven't sent you a document request yet.

Were you involved in any of the decision-making regarding Mr. Riley's treatment? How about the decisions to transfer him between medical facilities?

Was that unusual?

When did you learn that he'd passed away? Who contacted you? What did they say?

Is there anything you or your staff should have done differently regarding Mr. Riley in October of 2017?

Have you made any changes to policy or standard operating procedures at your facility as a consequence of what happened with Mr. Riley?

Is there anything I haven't asked you about that might help me understand what happened to Matthew Riley?

You work for the Department of Corrections, correct?

Where were you before that?

Tell me about the chain of command at the prison. How many direct reports do you have? Who are they?

How does the chain run from you to the individual officers who interact directly with the inmates?

If an inmate has a medical need, how is that communicated to your staff, and what happens at that point?

How would it be documented?

Is that standard operating procedure?

Are medical complaints ever not documented? Never?

How about problem inmates, people who might be make a lot of medical complaints because they want attention or some sort of different treatment, but might not actually be sick?

Who would make that determination?

Would it be possible that a person like that might be ignored, if not initially maybe after they've made a bunch of requests?

Do you specifically recall Matthew Riley?

What can you tell me about him?

We sued a corrections officer named Zelda Cumming who has never worked at your facility, is that correct?

You have a different officer, her sister, who did work for you?

And her name is Barbara Cumming?

Does she still work for you?

Was she involved in working with Matthew Riley in October of 2017?

Who was directly involved with Mr. Riley at that time?

Up the chain to you?

I'll represent that Mr. Riley's medical records indicate that he told people at the hospital he had been experiencing neurological symptoms for about two weeks.

Are they contract employees?

In this instance, how exactly did Mr. Riley bring his condition to the attention of the medical staff, do we know?

And if someone were to say that they do think he tried to bring his condition to the attention of medical staff, they would be saying something that isn't true, that's your testimony.

You are aware that Mr. Carnes, who was in the facility with Mr. Riley, says that they tried to get medical attention for Mr. Riley but that he was accused of malingering.

But that didn't happen.

And you know that because?

And you're 100% sure of that.

Who was Mr. Riley's actual cellmate, if that's the correct term?

Have you talked with anyone else who would have direct knowledge.

How many people in his area? Is it called a pod?

Would we be able to identify those people, as of October 17, 2018?

How about corrections officers who might have direct knowledge of Mr. Riley's condition on that date, can you identify them for me? Would you make them available for deposition?

How did you find out about Mr. Riley's medical condition, do you recall?

What did you know about Mr. Riley prior to October 17, 2017.
