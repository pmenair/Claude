Michael,

I look forward to working with you in this matter. I have some concerns about the discovery responses provided by Ms. Moore, your predecessor, discussed below. I also note that counsel for the defendant-in-counterclaim, copied on this email, will be unable to attend the depositions scheduled on 8/3 and 8/4. Please provide dates in August to reschedule those depositions, as well as a response to the concerns set out below, on or before close of business on July 12, 2022.

Ms. Jones's responses

Please note that, throughout, I believe your client's invocations of the Fifth Amendment privilege to be overly broad. However, I have elected not to challenge these responses in the context of the interrogatories, for the time being, subject to the expectation that these responses will be supplemented when the criminal proceedings are resolved.

Regarding Interrogatory 18, you object to producing information regarding your client's medical condition on the basis that your client has not "placed her medical condition in issue in this case." To begin with, information regarding your client's medical condition is reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence in this matter in that it may bear on causation of the accident. Moreover, and in any event, your client has, in fact, placed her physical condition at issue by alleging personal injury by way of counterclaim. Please supplement.

Regarding your client's response to requests for document production, I note that the Fifth Amendment privilege only applies to civil document discovery to the extent that the "act of production" may be considered testimonial. United States v. Doe, 465 U.S. 605 (1984). Our requests for photographs of the vehicle and the accident scene (Request 3), or repair bills (Request 4), or cell phone records (Request 11) cannot reasonably be construed as such. Please supplement.

Our request for social media account data (Request 12) is entirely reasonable, within the scope of discovery, and properly limited as to time. Please supplement.

Finally, although we disagree with the contention as to their exceeding the scope with respect to our contentions against Ms. Jones, our request for her driving history information is relevant, at the very least, to our negligent entrustment claim against the other defendants. Please supplement. If these documents are not in your client's possession, we would be happy to provide a form of authorization so that we may obtain these documents from the appropriate agency.

Mr. and Ms. Jespersenn

Your clients' response to Interrogatory 11, a contention interrogatory, was simply to state that Ms. Jesperson was "not involved in the accident." However, the interrogatory is no limited to their personal knowledge; we are attempting to discover the basis of their contention, in formal pleading, that the accident was caused by my client's negligence. It frankly defies credulity that these people "have no information" responsive to these interrogatories. Please supplement.

Interrogatories 12, 13, and 16 are standard and unobjectionable contention discovery. I understand that discovery is ongoing and will not seek to limit your clients to their responses. However, please supplement.

Please give me a call on my cell phone at 813-486-6637 if you wish to discuss these matters or anything else relevant to the case.
