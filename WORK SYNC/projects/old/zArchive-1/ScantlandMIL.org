PLAINTIFF'S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT'S FIRST MOTION IN LIMINE AND CROSS-MOTION IN LIMINE AND TO AMEND PRETRIAL ORDER

COMES NOW the above Plaintiff and responds to Defendant's First Motion in Limine as follows:

Plaintiff begins by noting that the matters contained in Defendant's First Motion in Limine were not raised at the pretrial conference and the parties have not had an opportunity to confer regarding Defendant's motion. However, Plaintiff do not object to the court's consideration of matters in limine and also moves for amendment of the pretrial order as set forth below. Plaintiff responds to the enumerated paragraphs of Defendant's motion as follows:

1 and 4. Evidence of Traffic Citations, Prior Accidents or Lawsuits

Liability is not at issue in this matter and no evidence is necessary to establish Defendant's fault, which is acknowledged by virtue of default and this Court's order and also is stipulated. Accordingly, these portions of Defendant's motion are moot.

2. Comparison with Other Claims

Defendant contends that references to other verdicts, claims, cases, injuries, and so forth should be excluded at trial. The only authority offered in support of this position is the relevance statute, OCGA § 24-4-401. Plaintiff's counsel is not aware of any authority suggesting that Plaintiff's counsel should be prevented from making appropriate arguments regarding the value of the case in open and close. Plaintiff does not intend to introduce evidence on this topic.

3. Personal Belief as to Credibility of Witnesses

Defendant asserts that Plaintiff's counsel should be ordered in limine not to comment upon the credibility of witnesses. In support of this position he cites the relevance and prejudice statutes, and also cites to case law holding that a criminal prosecutor should not state an opinion as to credibility or guilt. The case does not bear directly on this civil matter, nor does it suggest that counsel in a civil trial is not authorized to suggest to the jury that a witness has been impeached or is biased, or the value it should place on the case.

5 and 7. Evidence of Plaintiff's Attorney Fees and Insurance Coverage

Plaintiff agrees that evidence of fees or taxes that will be paid out of any recovery and insurance coverage are not relevant at trial.  Plaintiff WILL, however, request qualification of the jury respecting the relevant insurance carriers, and may seek to question jurors in voir dire regarding, for example, whether they have work experience in the field of insurance underwriting. Moreover, Plaintiff submits that no mention should be made by Defendant that any part of the medical bills of Plaintiff were paid by any health insurance carrier or other third party. Georgia law bars the Defendant from presenting any evidence of third-party payments, because a tortfeasor is not allowed to mitigate its liability by collateral payments provided by others. Candler Hosp. v. Dent, 228 Ga.App. 421, 421 (1997).

6. Financial Condition

Plaintiff intends to introduce his tax records and testimony regarding the financial impact of the wreck on her business income in support of loss of capacity to labor as an element of general damages. See also below regarding loss of income.

8. Settlement Discussions

Plaintiff will not seek to introduce evidence or settlement discussions, nor will Plaintiff's counsel reference them in the presence of the jury.

9. Medical Opinions

Plaintiff agrees with the general proposition that a layperson cannot give expert testimony. However, Plaintiff notes that his medical record itself is admissible in this case under the current evidence code, including portions of the medical record containing the opinions of his providers. OCGA § 24-8-803(6). Moreover, and in any event, “a person knows more about [her] injuries and suffering than a whole college of physicians and may testify as to same.” Guyer v. Savannah, 162 Ga. App. 598, 601 (1982). Plaintiff is entitled to discuss his condition and symptoms as he understands them.

10. Documents not Identified in the Pre-Trial Order

Plaintiff agrees with the general principle that documents should be disclosed to the opposing party prior to trial, but notes that both parties have identified documents by category and not always with specificity. Plaintiff will work with opposing counsel to exchange and mark exhibits pretrial.

11. Send a Message

Plaintiff's counsel will avoid reference to punitive damages or the "golden rule."

12. Special Damages

Plaintiff has pled her damages with sufficient particularity to satisfy OCGA 9-11-9(g). To the extent that those damages may have increased since the filing of those pleadings, Plaintiff has properly disclosed the increased amounts, and they are incorporated in the pretrial order in this matter.

OCGA § 9-11-9(g) is a rule of pleading that simply requires a litigant to state the types of special damages sought, to give the defendant fair notice of its claim. See Tri-County Investment Group, Ltd. v. Southern States, Inc., 231 Ga.App. 632, 638 (1998) (nuisance case where no special damages were alleged in pleading); Bellemead, Inc. v. Stoker, 280 Ga. 635, 639 (2006) (slander per se case in which no special damages were alleged in pleading); and McGee v. Gast, 257 Ga.App. 882, 885 (2002) (also slander per se). Here, Plaintiff has pled special damages in the form of medical expenses, discovery has been conducted respecting that claim, and supporting documents have been exchanged.

Plaintiff also seeks to introduce evidence regarding a loss of income claim that also was pled and disclosed in discovery. See below.

13. Multiple Locations

In support of moving to exclude evidence or argument regarding multiple locations of defense counsel, all that is cited (again) is the relevance statute. Plaintiff may reference that counsel has offices in numerous states in open or close and is not aware of any authority prohibiting him from doing so.

Cross-Motion in Limine

As suggested above, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court enter an order in limine to exclude evidence and argument regarding collateral source payments.

Motion to Amend Pretrial Order

Plaintiff also respectfully requests that the Court permit Plaintiff to amend the pretrial order in this matter to add his special damages claim for lost income in the amount of $5,915.52, which was omitted from the pretrial order due to a scrivener's error but was pled, disclosed in discovery, and discussed at Plaintiff's deposition. See Driggers v. Campbell, 247 Ga. App. 300 (2000) (amendment appropriate where no surprise).

Plaintiff also respectfully requests leave to add Shane Mangram, MD, Jeevana Krishna, and Adarsh Shetty, MD as may call health care providers, noting that Defendant has identified such witnesses only by category and not by name.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully prays that the Court enter an order in limine and pretrial consistent with the above, and that the Court grant such other and further relief as it deems proper and just.
