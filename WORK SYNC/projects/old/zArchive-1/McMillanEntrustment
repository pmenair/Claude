XXX OUTLINE (Entrustment)

This is the deposition of XXX, taken pursuant to notice and agreement of counsel for all purposes allowable under the Georgia Civil Practice Act. I propose we waive objection until the first lawful use of the deposition, except to form or responsiveness of the answer, if that is agreeable to counsel. {We have also stipulated to remote administration of the oath.}

Anything regarding signature at this time?

Please swear the witness.

XXX, my name is Paul Menair and I represent the plaintiff in a civil action against you. Have you ever given sworn testimony before, at a deposition or in court?

There are just a few ground rules I always go over before we start, and the first is that you are under oath. Do you understand what that means?

The second thing to remember is that the court reporter is trying to make a verbatim transcript of what we say. This means it's always important for us not to talk over each other. This is especially true because we are doing this by videoconference, and the software really only lets one person talk at a time. Okay?

I am not going to drag this out, but I am also game to take a break whenever you want, if you will agree to answer any question that's on the table before we break, other than questions your lawyer has specifically told you not to answer. Sound fair?

Please do not hesitate to ask me to clarify or rephrase a question, okay?

Alright. Without telling me what was said in any meeting with your lawyer, I assume you met with her to prepare for this deposition, correct?
