# OUTLINE

This is the deposition of John Michael Nelson, taken pursuant to notice and agreement of counsel under the Georgia Civil Practice Act for purpose of discovery and all other purposes allowable by law. My understanding is that we will be reserving objections, except to the form of the question and responsiveness of the answer, until the first lawful use of the deposition, is that agreeable? Would you like to put something on the record about signature?

Swear

Mr. Nelson, my name is Paul Menair, I'm an attorney with Steven Leibel PC and I represent Christopher Hopkins in the lawsuit against you. I appreciate your taking the time to be with us today, I understand that there was some hardship involved in your making the time to be here and I'm glad we found a way to accommodate that.

Have you ever given sworn testimony before?

I am going to ask you a series of questions. You are under oath. Do you understand what it means to be under oath?

The court reporter will be trying to make a written transcript of what we say here today, and it helps her if we try not to talk over each other, okay?

Please let me know if I interrupt you before you're finished, or if you don't understand a question, otherwise I will assume that you understood the question and gave me a complete response. Is that fair?

Please also try and keep in mind that the usual noises and hand signals and head nods that people use to communicate with don't translate very will into print, alright?

I am happy to take a break at any time you like, but if there's a question on the table I will ask you to answer it before you leave the room, fair enough?
