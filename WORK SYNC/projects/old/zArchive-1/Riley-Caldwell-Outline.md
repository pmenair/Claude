# Riley Caldwell Depo Outline

This is the deposition of Antoine Caldwell, taken pursuant to notice and agreement of counsel for all purposes allowable under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. My understanding is that all objections will be reserved until the first lawful use of the transcript and that the parties are all in agreement that Mr. Caldwell be deposed by remote videoconference and that he will be under oath today despite the fact that the person administering the oath is in a different physical location than the witness, is that all agreeable to counsel?

Do we want to make a record about signature or wait?

Please swear the witness. 

Mr. Caldwell, good afternoon. My name is Paul Menair. I represent Melissa Carey and Wallace Riley in a lawsuit against a number of parties, some of whom might not be the correct parties, arising from the death of Matthew Riley, who was an inmate at Johnson State Prison. I imagine you've been deposed before today, correct?

The same ground rules apply as any deposition, with the added wrinkle that we're doing this by videoconference, which makes it especially important for both of us to try not to talk over each other, because the software we're using makes it literally impossible for the Court reporter to hear two people trying to talk at once, okay?

Where are you physically located today? Is there anyone there in the room with you?

Did you mean with anyone to prepare for today's deposition? Without telling me what was said, who was present in that meeting?

Did you review any documents to prepare for today?

We are doing this deposition a little bit out of order, and I'm not pointing fingers at you in that regard, but I would like to see any documents that you used to refresh your recollection for today, okay?

I am always happy to take a break, but I will ask you to answer any unobjectionable questions that are on the table before we go on mute, does that sound fair?

Let's start with you, which is the traditional place to start. Where did you grow up?

What is your highest level of education?

Working backwards from that, where do you have degrees from? Where did you graduate from high school?

How did you end up in corrections?

I'm not going to ask you for your address or anything like that, I can reach you through counsel, correct?

I will ask you, though, what county you live in?

Do you have any relatives who live in the Atlanta Division of the Northern District of Georgia, which is Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Douglas, Fulton, Gwinnett, Henry, Newton and Rockdale?

Do you attend any religious institutions in any of those counties?

How about belong to any clubs?

Do you belong to any organizations associated with corrects? Do wardens have a listserv, anything like that?

Are you still at Johnson State Prison?

When did you start at Johnson State? As warden?

Where were you before that?

Tell me about the chain of command at the prison. How many direct reports do you have? Who are they?

How does the chain run from you to the individual officers who interact directly with the inmates?

If an inmate has a medical need, how is that communicated to your staff, and what happens at that point?

How would it be documented?

Is that standard operating procedure?

Are medical complaints ever not documented? Never?

How about problem inmates, people who might be make a lot of medical complaints because they want attention or some sort of different treatment, but might not actually be sick?

Who would make that determination?

Would it be possible that a person like that might be ignored, if not initially maybe after they've made a bunch of requests?

Do you specifically recall Matthew Riley?

What can you tell me about him?

We sued a corrections officer named Zelda Cummings who has never worked at your facility, is that correct?

You have a different officer, her sister, who did work for you?

And her name is Barbara Cummings?

Does she still work for you?

Was she involved in working with Matthew Riley in October of 2017?

Who was directly involved with Mr. Riley at that time?

Up the chain to you?

I'll represent that Mr. Riley's medical records indicate that he told people at the hospital he had been experiencing neurological symptoms for about two weeks. And as I believe you know, we've been told that he attempted to bring that to the attention of your staff at the prison. But the disclosures that were filed on your behalf by counsel in this case state that Mr. Riley failed to bring those symptoms to the attention of prison medical staff. Sitting here today, do you believe that to be true and correct, that he failed to notify prison medical staff of his symptoms and need for medical attention?

How sure are you of that? Why?

I think there is a difference between notifying medical staff and notifying corrections officer. Do you believe he failed to notify the officers responsible for his custody as well? Sure? Why?

The medical staff at the prison saw the decedent on October 17, 2017, and immediately had him transported to the hospital, correct?

Are they contract employees?

In this instance, how exactly did Mr. Riley bring his condition to the attention of the medical staff, do we know?

And if someone were to say that they do think he tried to bring his condition to the attention of medical staff, they would be saying something that isn't true, that's your testimony.

You are aware that Mr. Carnes, who was in the facility with Mr. Riley, says that they tried to get medical attention for Mr. Riley but that he was accused of malingering.

But that didn't happen. 

And you know that because?

And you're 100% sure of that.

Who was Mr. Riley's actual cellmate, if that's the correct term?

Have you talked with anyone else who would have direct knowledge.

How many people in his area? Is it called a pod?

Would we be able to identify those people, as of October 17, 2018?

How about corrections officers who might have direct knowledge of Mr. Riley's condition on that date, can you identify them for me? Would you make them available for deposition?

How did you find out about Mr. Riley's medical condition, do you recall?

What did you know about Mr. Riley prior to October 17, 2017.

Tell me about your personal involvement in his situation after October 17, 2017.

Did you talk to his family members?

Did you talk to medical staff at your facility?

How about the corrections officers, did you talk with them on or after October 17, 2017, about Mr. Riley.

Dr. Sharon Lewis, same question.

How often do you deal with Dr. Lewis?

Were you involved in any of the decision making regarding Mr. Riley's treatment? How about the decisions to transfer him between medical facilities?

When did you learn that he'd passed away? Who contacted you? What did they say?

Is there anything you or your staff should have done differently regarding Mr. Riley in October of 2017?

Have you made any changes to policy or standard operating procedures at your facility as a consequence of what happened with Mr. Riley?

Complaint clearly states vicarious liability as to GNI. Statute ran in 2019, so we probably can't add the other doctor, but see Rich's, Inc. v. Snyder, 134 Ga. App. 889 (1975). Be sure to ask at the deposition about when he knew about the lawsuit and whether he thinks he should have been named (OCGA 9-11-15). Also, after the deposition, amend the affidavit. Complaint probably does not need to be amended. SKL and Lubin agree that the EMS/Nurse/Intubation angle is a rabbit trail. Also ask the doctor for his cell phone number that weekend, we may want to get from provider. 

Todo: Notice Joe Sam Robinson? This is probably a case where I should start the trial folders early and do a more complete review than I ordinarily do of what has beene xchanged in discovery.
