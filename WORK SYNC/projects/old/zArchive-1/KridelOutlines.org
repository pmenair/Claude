This is the deposition of Krystle Ivies, taken pursuant to notice and agreement of counsel under the Georgia civil practice act for all purposes including discovery, cross-examination, and use at trial.  Under the rules and by stipulation of the parties, objections will be reserved until the first lawful use of the transcript of these proceedings, except as to privilege, form of the question, and responsiveness of the answer.  We have also agreed to take this deposition by videoconference, with the officer administering the oath in a different physical location than the witness.  Is all that agreeable, and do you want to make a record regarding signature?

Please swear in the witness.

Good morning, Ms. Ivie, my name is Paul Menair and I represent Geoffrey Kridel in a lawsuit against Northeast Georgia, Inc., the company that owns the McDonald's franchise in Dahlonega, and some McDonald's entities.  The case relates to a slip and fall incident at the restaurant, and you've been identified as a witness, not necessarily to the fall itself, but to various matters that might be relevant to the case.  If I say "McDonald's" today, I will most likely be referring to the physical location where my client fell.  If I want to talk about McDonald's corporate, or Northeast Georgia, Inc., I'll try to make that clear.  But if there is any confusion, about that or anything else, please ask me to clarify, okay?

Please feel free to let me know if you need a break, the only think I will ask is that you please answer any questions that are already on the table before we break, okay?

The court reporter also wants me to ask you to please try not to interrupt me, and I'll do the same. It helps her a lot if you would do that, and also try to speak clearly and in words that she can type into the transcript, instead of gestures or noises that aren't words. Fair?

Could you please state and spell your full name for the record. Krystle Ives.

Did you meet with anyone other than counsel to get ready for today's deposition?

Let's start with my client's fall. How, personally, did you come to learn about my client's fall?

Who have you talked to about the fall?

We'll come back to this in detail later, but what is your understanding of what happened?

Let's talk about McDonalds for a moment.  What do you know about the relationship of Northeast Georgia, Inc. and the various McDonald's corporate entities?

Do you ever interact with anyone at McDonald's corporate?

Does McDonald's corporate, to your knowledge, have anything to do with the day to day operation of the store where my client fell?  And here I'm talking specifically about McDonald's USA, LLC and the McDonald's Corporation.

Do you know who owns the real estate where the restaurant is located?

Walk me through the training you've received?  In general.  Specifically re fall prevention.  

Who owns Northeast Georgia, Inc.?

Are there any other owners, that you know of?

Do you do anything else for the company, other than manage the restaurant?

Does Northeast Georgia, Inc. do anything else, like run other restaurants?

I don't want to know any of the details, but was there an internal investigation of the incident we're here about today?  Who did you talk to?  When?

I'll represent that you are the only witness identified in the discovery responses, do you believe that's accurate?

Do you know if anyone actually saw the fall?

Who was working the day of the fall?

[ ] schedule re employees

[ ] only downloaded date

Did you, personally, do any investigation?

How long after the fall did you find out about it?

Did you attempt to preserve video?

What happened with that?

Who is Brian Kinney (assisted with responses)?

No one talked to you the day of the fall.

To your knowledge, no one reported anything to anyone the day of the fall.

You eventually made a recorded statement to the insurance company, correct?

Did you believe or understand that there might be a lawsuit at the time you made that statement?

Has your opinion or knowledge about the incident changed in any way since you made the recorded statement?

How about during the time between when you first learned about the fall  and the statment.

Who did you talk to at the restaurant about the fall?

Other than insurance company representatives, who have you talked to at McDonalds corporate or Northeast Georgia, Inc. about the fall?

Anybody else, friends, family, anyone?

Have you put anything in writing, posted on social media, anything like that?

Have you spoken with any safety experts or other types of experts who may have investigated this case?

Tell me about the video at the store. How many cameras are there? Inside v. outside?

[ ] Crystal Malmaburg, CNA

Is there a camera that would have recorded in the vestibule area where the fall happened?

What happens to the video? Is it maintained on site, do you use a vendor, or does McDonalds have some sort of central facility for that?

When you attempted to preserve video, walk me through how that worked.

Do you have an assistant manager? That day?

Who else was working that day? Duties? What is the composition of a shift?

How often is the parking lot power washed?

Who does it? Do you have a vendor, or do your own employees do that?

[ ] 4:30-5 on a Friday, David Torres, K through Northeast Georgia, Inc.

How is it done, walk me through the job?

Do you use degreaser when you clean the parking lot?

How is it applied? Removed?

Is it slippery?

How are people trained in doing it?

After it's done, is the parking lot left wet?

Do you put out wet floor signs, or any signage?

Why would they close the drive through during power washing?

Has that ever caused any issues with folks slipping in the lot or tracking water into the store and slipping on tile?

How often are the floors cleaned inside?

Do you keep track of when that happens?

If there's a floor cleanup after a spill, say, is that recorded anywhere?

How do you go about cleaning up a spill?

How are people trained in doing that?

Has anyone ever fallen in the store that you're aware of?  How about outside?  Injuries?

Who inspects the parking lot?  Daily?  What do they look for?

If a floor is wet, do you put out wet floor signs?

What's the policy on that, to your knowledge?

Do the tile areas inside the restaurant, especially near the doors, ever get wet when it rains?

When that happens, do they get slippery?

Do you look our for that?

The area in the vestibule is tile, yes?  

Let's look at some exhibits.

So you do not use any third party vendors for routine cleaning of floors or daily inspection and maintenance, correct?

And I take this to mean that there are policies all employees are subject to that require them to be on the look out for slip hazards, fair?

Tell me about those policies.

Are there employees specifically assigned to floor cleaning?

How often are the floors cleaned, setting aside spills. Cleaning the whole floor?

After you found out about the fall, were there any changes made to procedures, investigations conducted into how a fall might have happened, any response at all, other than your statements?

Did anyone take any pictures?

Who took the pictures we looked at?

I'll represent that certain documents were produced to us as confidential documents that purport to be copies of the lease and the franchise agreement. Are you able to identify those documents, or would I need to talk to Mr. Sworszowski?

The vestibule are where my client he fell was an area where he was permitted to be, correct?

I'm hoping not to have to designate the next portion of the deposition as confidential because we're going to look at some policy documents that were produced, but if you will agree that they are authentic I don't think we need to attach them, if that's okay with you Sean.

I just want to establish that it's a complete policy production.

I'm showing you what was recently produced to us under a confidential designation.

There are 152 pages to this Operations and Training Manual, I'll just go through it so you can see.

Are you familiar with this document?

Does it appear to be complete?

What is it?

Is this a print out of something you've looked at online?

Are these the operations procedures you follow in managing the restaurant?

I'll represent that in the text it says that franchisees should consider adopting their own policies. Does Northeast Georgia, Inc. have any different or supplemental operations policies that you're aware of?

I'd like to bring your attention to p. 75

This is the beginning of the section on prevention of slip and fall injuries, correct?

Are these the policies of the restaurant you manage, regarding prevention of slip and fall incidents?

Anything missing from here?

Anything you want to bring up that's responsive to any of my earlier questions, that this might have refreshed your recollection about.

Moving on to the next document, this is a cleaning and maintenance manual, yes?

Again, is this the manual that you use for policies and procedures regarding cleaning and maintenance?

Does this look like a complete copy?

Any different or supplemental policies at the franchise?

Is there anything we haven't talked about you think is relevant to this case.

Thank you for your time today, ma'am.
