Norman v. Jones Lang Lasalle Americas, Inc., 277 Ga. App. 621, 627 S.E.2d 382 (Ga. Ct. App. 2006)

P walked into unlit room, tripped over boxes. She knew about the lighting condition, not the boxes. Court found she couldn't prove her employer knew more  about the boxes than she did, not enough evidence re the alleged code violation to make it a per se case.

Brown v. RFC Management, Inc., 189 Ga. App. 603 (Ga. Ct. App. 1988) is similarly a case involving prior knowledge of conditions, in this case a poorly lit staircase with worn carpeting.
