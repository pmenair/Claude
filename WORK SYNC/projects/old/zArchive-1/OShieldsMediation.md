# O'Shields mediation case

Starts at 53k v. 350k, opening move to 60k.

They like Stacey and this is a truck case BUT:

1. Damage to Stacey's vehicle was minimal, truck went into ditch because driver was trying to avoid.

2. Causation issues:

	* Back issues prior. Active issues before the accident, first appointment after the accident had already been scheduled, numbness prior. Looking at surgery prior. May not get the money for the discectomy.
	
	* Hernia from multiple pregnancies, prior surgery. Could be a tough sell.
	
	* Adrenal crash. Months after the accident. Caused by a fender bender? Jury is going to be sceptical.
	
	* Lost wages relate to the adrenal issue - going to be a serious causation issue here.
	
	* Knee surgery prior also, had to go in and clean up from the surgery, not necessarily related. No immediate complaint.
	
They say 48k related even with the discectomy. Defendant's best day is DOL 7k and say 20k of back treatment, then pain and suffering, so reasonable chance of a 50k verdict.

SKL - they will have a hard time saying she's a liar. Not malingering. Let's say 50k only, still clear liability, faulty equipment part is important. 10x specials is still .5MM. Jury will know it's trucking insurance and/or State Farm. We'll go to 300k.

Stacey - Knee did hurt, no bone fragments prior, didn't complain about knee but felt it. Incontinent in wreck, mesh came out. Cortisol from surgery stress, etc. Back was tolerable prior to the wreck, couldn't use toilet after the wreck. Tried to avoid surgery. 

--> CZ. 65k is the next, can't send a signal there's a lot of room but there is room. Bracket? 

--> SKL says ask them for a bracket. I'm going to take depositions of treatings, they are going to get a paid expert. I'm not moving at 65k. 

--> CZ they went to 70

--> SKL 250k

--> CZ 80k they didn't want to bracket

--> SKL 249.5k

--> CZ no response

--> SKL We'll got to 225 if you go to 125, we're at 245 hard money

--> CZ they appreciate the bracket BUT all they can do is make a hard move to 85,000 and say they are running out of room. Doctors might agree with them on causation.

--> SKL we'll go to 235k.

--> CZ they feel strongly about medical causation. They want to end it today. There's a little more.

--> SKL final and best?

--> CZ I think they are stopping at 100. If you want to feel out their final number, you need to come closer.

--> SKL We'll go to 150 if they go to 100.

--> CZ final negotiation; if you demand 100, they will pay it, but only today.

--> SKL they have a deal at 125, we'll disiss without prejudice and cooperate with subro.

--> CZ if we finish by 2, my fee is 500

--> SKL they can pay 101, or they can cover the cost

--> CZ nope

--> SKL 100, dismiss wo prej, State Farm out on everything, release, lien aff, if State Farm subro Stacey gets excess

--> CZ she can't agree to that, but K SF can only recover what they pay out.

--> SKL done. they will get 60k
