RESPONSE TO MOTION FOR DETERMINATION OF EXPERT FEE

Presently before the Court is Defendants Kimberly Stanley and USIOM, LLC's Motion to Determine Reasonableness of Expert Fees (the "Motion" of "Defendants"). Pursuant to OCGA ยง 9-11-26(b)(4)(A)(ii), which provides for determination by the Court of the reasonableness of fees charged by a litigant's retained expert for discovery participation, Defendants seek a determination by the Court that the fee schedule of Plaintiff's neurology expert, Joel S. Wolinsky, is unreasonable "based on what experts generally charge for their deposition testimony." (Ds. Br. Supp. Mot. at 2.)

Defendants cite to persuasive, but not binding, federal authority on the subject of fee reasonableness. They concede that the quoted rate is the expert's "standard rate." (Ds. Br. Supp. Mot. at 4.) However, they insist that the fee is "unreasonable on its face" because, apparently, their experts charge less. (Id.)

A review of Dr. Wolinsky's curriculum vitae shows that he is an experienced practitioner is an elite medical field. Defence counsel intends to travel to take his deposition, and one assumes there will be expense associated with their travel, as well as counsel fees. Attached hereto as Exhibit A are documents showing that Plaintiff has regularly retained similarly qualified experts billing between $1,000 and $1,500 for expert testimony.[fn][Saman Hazany, MD is a neuroradiologist. Nathan Jove, MD is an orthopedic surgeon. Andrew Sherman, MD is a a psyiatrist. Shazad Wada, MD is a pain specialist.] The challenged fee is his fee for testimony, not record review. 

Moreover, although Defendants contend that there is a "paucity" of Georgia authority on the issue, Georgia authority exists and is in fact quite clear: Because a finding of unreasonableness essentially shifts the burden of paying fees onto the other party, the party taking an expert's deposition must pay that expert's entire fee unless to require the party to do so would result in "manifest injustice." Barnum v. Coastal Health Services, 288 Ga. App. 209, 216 (2007). This determination is guided, under binding, Georgia law, by consideration of the following factors:

"[T]he possible hardships imposed on the respective parties; the need for doing justice on the merits between the parties; whether a party is indigent; and the need for maintaining orderly and efficient procedural arrangements."

Id. 

Here, Defendants are not indigent, they will suffer no significant hardship by having to pay for Dr. Wolinsky's time at his ordinary rate, there are no unusual considerations of justice involved in this fairly ordinary medical malpractice suit, and the ordinary procedure of having the defense pay for a deposition they elect to take is both orderly and efficient.

The motion should be denied.
