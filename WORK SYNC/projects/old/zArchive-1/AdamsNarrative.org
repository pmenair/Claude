My name is Dave Seecharan, MD. I am a board-certified neurosurgeon practicing with Apex Spine and Neurosurgery in Alpharetta, Bethlehem, Columbus, and Suwanee, Georgia. I have a Bachelor of Science degree in neuroscience with a molecular biology minor from Vanderbilt University in Tennessee. I received my medical degree from the University of Tennessee Health Science Center in Memphis, completed a general surgery internship at the University of Kansas Department of Surgery in Kansas City, and was a resident in neurological surgery at the University of Kansas Department of Neurosurgery. I have been licensed to practice Medicine in the State of Georgia since November 6, 2015. I am submitting this report in narrative form for admission at trial in the matter of Shawn Adams v. Luke Volle and Carl Volle, Civil Action No. 2021SV163D, Hall County State Court.

Shawn Adams first visited my office on October 9, 2022, complaining of moderate to severe back pain in his lumbar or lower back region. He had previously treated for both neck and back pain with a sports medicine doctor, who gave him injections in his spine that provided about a year of relief. It is not unusual for that form of treatment to give relief that turns out to only be temporary. I ordered an MRI or magnetic resonance imaging of his lower back and also asked him to bring in copies of some older imaging that had previously been done.

I saw him again on October 9, 2022, and reviewed the imaging with him. Based on the nature of the symptoms, the patient history, and the imaging available to me, I concluded and remain of the opinion that, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, Mr. Adams' condition arose from disc herniations or bulging in both the neck and lower back, which were and are more likely than not caused by the motor vehicle accident he was involved in during 2019. I noted that additional imaging of the cervical vertebrae or the spine in his neck might be called for and discussed the possiblity of surgery in his lower back.

I saw him next on December 7, 2022, and at that visit I ordered an MRI of Mr. Adams' neck, which I reviewed with him on February 16, 2023. At that visit we discussed the possibility of neck surgery.

On April 24, 2023, I operated on Mr. Adams' neck. Specifically, I performed a decompression and stabilization to relieve compression or pressure on the spinal nerves caused by bulging of the discs at the spaces between the C5 and C6, and C6 and C7, vertebrae, or bones in his neck. This procedure involved both the removal of bone and disc material and the installation of hardware to relieve pressure on his nerves. In my opinion, this procedure was reasonable and necessary treatment for his condition, and the amount billed by my office was reasonable and customary for this procedure.

In my opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, Mr. Adams will also eventually need surgery to his lumbar spine or lower back.
