This policy is intended to supplement but not replace any applicable state and federal laws governing conflict of interest applicable to nonprofit and charitable organizations.

12.2 Definitions.

a. Interested Person. Any director, principal officer, member of acommittee with governing board delegated powers, or any other person who is a"disqualified person" as defined in Section 4958(f)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code as amplified by Section 53.4958-3 of the IRS Regulations, who has adirect or indirect financial interest, as defined below, is an interested person,

1. An ownership or investment interest in any entity with which the corporation has a transaction or arrangement;

2. A compensation arrangement with the corporation or with any entity or individual with which the corporation has a transaction or arrangement; or

3. A potential ownership or investment interest in, or compensation arrangement with, any entity or individual with which the corporation is negotiating atransaction or arrangement.

Compensation includes direct and indirect remuneration as well as gifts or favors that are not insubstantial. A financial interest is not necessarily a conflict of interest. A person who has afinancial interest may have a conflict of interest only if the appropriate governing board or committee decides that a conflict of interest exists.

In connection with any actual or possible conflict of interest, an interested person must disclose the existence of the financial interest and be given the opportunity to disclose all material facts to the directors and members of committees with governing board delegated powers considering the proposed transaction or arrangement,

The remaining board or committee members shall decide if aconflict of interest exists,

The chairperson of the governing board or committee shall, if appropriate, appoint adisinterested person or committee to investigate alternatives to the proposed transaction or arrangement. After exercising due diligence, the governing board or committee shall determine whether the corporation can obtain with reasonable efforts a more advantageous transaction or arrangement from aperson or entity that would not give rise to a conflict of interest. If amore advantageous transaction or arrangement is not reasonably possible under circumstances not producing aconflict of interest, the governing board ocommittee shall determine by amajority vote of the disinterested directors whether the transaction or arrangement is in the corporation's best interest, for its own benefit, and whether it is fair and reasonable. In conformity with the above determination, it shall make its decision as to whether to enter into the transaction or arrangement,

d. Violations of the Conflicts of Interest Policy. If the governing board or committee has reasonable cause to believe a member has failed to disclose actual or possible conflicts of interest, it shall inform the member of the basis for such belief and afford the member an opportunity to explain the alleged failure to disclose. If, after hearing the member's response and after making further investigation as warranted by the circumstances, the governing board or committee determines the member has failed to disclose an actual or possible conflict of interest, it shall take appropriate disciplinary and corrective action.

12.4 Records of Board and Board Committee Proceedings. The minutes of meetings of the governing board and all committees with board delegated powers shall contain; The names of the persons who disclosed or otherwise were found to have a financial interest in connection with an actual or possible conflict of interest, the nature of the financial interest, any action taken to determine whether aconflict of interest was present, and the governing board's or committee's decision as to whether a conflict of interest in fact existed.

4. If the board or compensation committee determines that reasonable compensation for a specific position in this organization or for providing services under any other compensation arrangement with this organization is higher or lower than the range of comparability data obtained, the board or committee shall record in the minutes of the meeting the basis for its determination;

7. The minutes of board or committee meetings at which compensation arrangements are approved must be prepared before the later of the date of the next board or committee meeting or 60 days after the final actions of the board or committee are taken with respect to the approval of the compensation arrangements.
