Text: 70, 71 (1) (413 SE2d 720) (1992) (claim arising from hospital’s use of wrong replacement parts in piece of medical equipment did not assert medical malpractice claim); see also Sood v. Smeigh, 259 Ga. App. 490, 494 (1) (578 SE2d 158) (2003) (assembly of prosthetic patella backwards constituted ordinary negligence and did not require submission of an expert affidavit) (physical precedent only). Moreover, the fact that a nurse with medical experience provided the wheelchair for Byrom and pushed her around the hospital in it does not make this a medical malpractice claim because these acts did not require the nurse to exercise her medical judgment. Dent v. Mem. Hosp. of Adel, 270 Ga. 316, 318 (509 SE2d 908) (1998). Certainly, in this case, no expert is necessary to help a jury understand the instructions on the wheelchair handles that constituted the manufacturer’s guidelines for safe use of the wheelchair. Thus, Byrom’s claims are not for medical malpractice. Accordingly, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Douglas Hospital based on a failure to file an expert affidavit. 7 2. Byrom also argues the trial court erred in finding that she had equal or superior knowledge of the risk posed by the wheelchair’s foot pedals. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the trial court erred in applying the equal or superior knowledge analysis to Byrom’s claims and, therefore erred in granting summary judgment to Douglas Hospital. Just as not all claims against a hospital constitute medical malpractice, not all claims which arise from an injury sustained inside a building constitute premises liability, regardless of how the claim is argued by the parties. Georgia law distinguishes between negligence cases where a condition on the premises causes injury to someone and those where an employee’s active negligence causes injury to someone. Lipham v. Federated Dept. Stores, Inc., 263 Ga. 865 (440 SE2d 193) (1994). Liability is determined under the framework of premises liability only if an injury is caused by a condition of the premises over which the premises owner/operator has some degree of control, such as a static condition or passive defect. Id. If an injury is caused by the active negligence of an owner/occupier’s employee, however, ordinary negligence principles apply. Id.

Text: 124, 126, 413 S.E.2d 445 ("[h]owever, where the alleged negligence arises from static or passive conditions, the landowner owes the anticipated trespasser a duty not to injure him wilfully or wantonly"); Wade v. Mitchell, 206 Ga. App. 265, 266(2)(b), 424 S.E.2d 810 ("[a]ppellant was not injured by any defect on the truck stop premises pre-existing his arrival thereon"). See also Adams & Adams, supra at p. 69, § 3-5 ("[n]ote that this liability deals with active negligence and not with a static condition"). Thus, it is wrong to apply a rule applicable to active negligence cases in cases alleging a defect existing on the premises. "If the injury arises not from a preexisting defect in the premises but from a claim of active negligence arising from the owner's or occupant's alleged acts or omissions occurring at the time the plaintiff was on the premises, the liability test is the general negligence standard of foreseeability, rather than the more restrictive superior knowledge test." Adams & Adams, supra at p. 99, § 4-1. Where an injury is caused by a condition on the property, "the act of the owner must be a wilful and wanton act in order for the injured party to recover. While, where the presence of the injured party on the owner's premises is known or should have been anticipated, the duty owing to him, whether he be classified as a trespasser or licensee is to use ordinary care to avoid inflicting injuries on him, it is also usually wilful or wanton not to exercise ordinary care to prevent injuring a person who is actually known to be or may reasonably be expected to be, within range of a dangerous act being done or a hidden peril on one's premises."

Text: To answer that question, we first examine the premises liability law applicable to this case. (a) Background Principles of Landowner and Landlord Liability Generally, a landowner has a duty to keep its premises safe for visitors, and this duty “depends, to a certain extent, on whether the one entering the property is an invitee, a licensee or a trespasser.” Lipham v. Federated Dept. Stores, Inc., 263 Ga. 865, 865 (440 SE2d 193) (1994). This duty is codified, in relevant part, in OCGA §§ 513-1, 51-3-2, and 51-3-3. The first of these code sections establishes that a landowner owes a duty of ordinary care “in keeping the premises and approaches safe” when the landowner has extended an invitation to the visitor: Where an owner or occupier of land, by express or implied invitation, induces or leads others to come upon his premises for any lawful purpose, he is liable in damages to such persons for injuries caused by his failure to 8 exercise ordinary care in keeping the premises and approaches safe. OCGA § 51-3-1. The next code section defines “licensees” and clarifies that landowners owe a different and lower standard of care—liability only for “willful or wanton injury”—for visitors who are classified as licensees: (a) A licensee is a person who: (1) Is neither a customer, a servant, nor a trespasser; (2) Does not stand in any contractual relation with the owner of the premises; and (3) Is permitted, expressly or impliedly, to go on the premises merely for his own interests, convenience, or gratification. (b) The owner of the premises is liable to a licensee only for willful or wanton injury. OCGA § 51-3-2. The third code section likewise establishes that a landowner owes no duty of care to a visitor classified as a trespasser, “except to refrain from causing a willful or wanton injury.” OCGA § 51-3-3 (b). In explaining the distinction between invitees and licensees, we have stated that “the determining question as to whether a visitor is an invitee by implication or a licensee is whether or not the 9 owner or occupant of the premises will receive some benefit, real or supposed, or has some interest in the purpose of the visit.” Anderson v.

Text: Baird clearly deals with the existence of a static condition that was not a mantrap; the owner/occupier of the premises has no duty to warn a trespasser of such condition. Lipham deals with the active negligence of an employee which is directed at a licensee on the premises. Lipham does not stand for the proposition that all negligence with respect to the premises or approaches referred to in OCGA § 51-3-1 is passive negligence. Acts of an owner/occupier of the premises can create a dangerous condition on the premises. Such acts would constitute active negligence and do not become static just because the condition exists prior to the arrival of the invitee or licensee. Where the acts or omissions of the owner/occupier work positive injury to others, such acts or omissions are active negligence in the classic sense. See Smith & Prosser, Cases & Materials on Torts, p. 320(1). Where the owner/occupier of the premises either through malfeasance (commission of an act wrongful in itself), misfeasance (improper performance of an act), or non-feasance (the failure to perform an act) creates a reasonable, foreseeable danger to an invitee, then knowledge is presumed or imputed to the owner/occupier, because it is the tortfeasor's act or omission that created the danger or allowed the danger to continue unabated or without warning. Lipham, supra at 865, 440 S.E.2d 193 ; Wade v. Mitchell, supra at 266-267, 424 S.E.2d 810 ; American Nat. Bank, etc. v. Howard, 117 Ga.App. 834, 161 S.E.2d 838 (1968). In the case sub judice, Hartley testified that he slipped in new oil on the floor; new oil is not a "foreign" substance but is indigenous to a garage as part of the product, as well as waste by-product. Davidson and Moss testified that there was no oil on the floor, only rain water, which is a foreign substance brought into the premises. Neither Moss nor Davidson saw the substance on which Hartley slipped prior to his fall. The alleged presence of new oil on the repair bay floor is circumstantial evidence that the oil got there by the acts or omissions of appellee's employees as active negligence, because only they had possession and control over the area and the new oil. See Foster v. Jones, 64 Ga.App.

Text: Thus, in Bradley, supra at 201, the Supreme Court clarified the general legal duty owed to the world as follows: "`[N]egligence is conduct which falls below the standard established by law for the protection of others against unreasonable risk of harm.'" (Emphasis supplied.) Id. at 201; accord Dupree v. Keller Indus., 199 Ga. App. 138, 142 (2) (404 SE2d 291). Bradley merely reaffirms the general legal duty to protect other humans against unreasonable risk of harm; it does not purport to set a legal standard applicable to each and every conceivable tortious situation. Ellington v. Tolar Constr. Co., 237 Ga. 235 (227 SE2d 336), involving a suit for injuries sustained at a construction site by a laborer employed by a subcontractor against the general contractor, is distinguishable from this case. The complaint in this case avers an alleged act of active negligence committed by an employee of the owner or occupier of the premises where the incident occurred against a third party on the premises. Accordingly, we must now establish appellant's legal status on the premises at the time of the incident to determine the correct legal standard to apply in this case. The test of status of third party as a licensee is well established by statute and case law. See generally OCGA § 51-3-2; Savage v. Flagler Co., 185 Ga. App. 334, 337 (2) (364 SE2d 52). Although appellant averred in her complaint that she was an invitee, she made the following uncontroverted admissions of fact in her deposition (see generally Shansab v. Homart Dev. Co., 205 Ga. App. 448, 451 (4) (422 SE2d 305); Pate v. Ga. Southern &c. R. Co., 196 Ga. App. 211, 212 *387 (395 SE2d 604)): She was walking around the outside of Rich's before it was opened for business; she was merely using Rich's sidewalk; the only reason she went to the mall and Rich's was to walk outside; she was not going to do any shopping at the mall, and she spoke to no one either before or after voluntarily joining the crowd in the parking lot. These admissions have not been withdrawn and, even if they could be contradicted, no such evidence exists in this record.

Answer: Yes, it is possible to bring an active negligence claim in a premises liability suit in Georgia. Georgia law distinguishes between claims arising from static or passive conditions on the premises and those resulting from active negligence by an owner or occupier's employee. When an injury is caused by an active negligence, ordinary negligence principles apply instead of premises liability principles. As stated in the precedents, "If an injury is caused by the active negligence of an owner/occupier’s employee... ordinary negligence principles apply" (Lipham v. Federated Dept. Stores, Inc., 263 Ga. 865, 440 SE2d 193 (1994)).

Active negligence involves acts or omissions of the premises owner or occupier that create a foreseeable danger to others. This form of negligence is characterized by a positive act that results in injury, as opposed to a pre-existing static condition on the property. For example, in the context of premises liability, if an employee of the premises actively creates a hazardous condition that leads to injury, such as improperly assembling equipment or spilling a substance that causes a slip and fall, this can be considered active negligence (Trammell v. Baird).

Therefore, while traditional premises liability often involves conditions of the premises themselves, an active negligence claim focuses on the conduct of the owner or occupier, or their employees, and is evaluated under the general negligence standard of foreseeability rather than the superior knowledge test used for static conditions.

[Assistant]

Let me help research Georgia law regarding active negligence claims in premises liability cases.

Based on the provided case law, it appears that active negligence claims can be distinct from premises liability claims in Georgia. The key distinction lies in whether the claim involves a condition of the premises or an active act of negligence by an employee.

This distinction is clearly illustrated in the Lipham v. Federated Department Stores case, where the court noted that the case did not concern a condition of the premises that the store could control or warn about, but rather involved "an act of active negligence on the part of a Rich's employee." [^1]

Recent cases continue to recognize this distinction. In a 2023 case involving CVS Pharmacy, the court acknowledged that active negligence claims are treated differently from premises liability claims. [^2] This distinction was also at issue in a recent federal case where a plaintiff specifically argued that her slip and fall claim should have been analyzed under an active negligence theory rather than a premises liability theory. [^3]

The key consideration appears to be whether the injury resulted from a condition of the property itself (premises liability) versus active conduct by an employee or agent (active negligence). When a plaintiff cannot establish the elements of a premises liability claim, such as superior knowledge of a dangerous condition, they may still potentially pursue recovery under an active negligence theory if the facts support such a claim. This is demonstrated in the Aderhold case, where the plaintiff abandoned the premises liability theory when they couldn't prove superior knowledge of the dangerous condition. [^4]

Therefore, while these claims can arise from the same incident, they represent distinct legal theories with different elements that must be proven, and both can be viable options depending on the specific facts of the case.
