Initial disclosures done, need to do written discovery, WI depositions, save site visit for later. Get rogs from experts?

- disclosures: They identify a bunch of TN employees. Send to our expert for advice about interrogatories, policy discovery. Depose Marc Playman *individually* re venue, policies. Get with expert input re list of policies for Playman, will send document request first. Playman seems to technically be employed by Wilderness Resorts and Waterparks, Inc., they may object to making him available, but I suppose we could subpoena him. Control issues will be fun to tease out. NOT REFERENCE TO VIDEO NOT PRODUCED

  What does Wisconsin law say on prejudgment interest?
Proslide information - send subpoena or ask OCN to get these documents?
SKL wants to take the depo of the President of Wilderness Development Corporation
Can we go for excess in an insurer in an event where they don’t pay the limits within a certain time?
Need to set up a meeting for all three attys to discuss this case once SKL gets back from LOA

[ ] proslide, canadian company, wouldn't go down design defects rabbit trail, but there is a manual

lifeguards at fault, more of a training issue, not trained to radio down, clearly outlined in the standards, man who went first was wearing sandals, might have slowed him down and got him stuck, safety signage specifically says no footwear
